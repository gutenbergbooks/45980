<p>The Editor recognises that the admirers of Rowlandson's peculiar graphic
productions, and those fortunate amateurs who are able to indulge their taste
for collecting caricatures and works embellished with humorous illustrations, will
not expect any excuse for the preparation and appearance of the present work:
he anticipates that&mdash;in spite of much that he would improve&mdash;the two volumes
devoted to a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">r&eacute;sumé</i> of the great Caricaturist, with the multifarious, ludicrous,
and grotesque creations which emanated from his fertile fancy, will be accepted
as, in some degree, supplying that which, without being absolutely indispensable,
has frequently been instanced as a compilation likely to be acceptable to the
appreciators of graphic and literal satire.</p>

<p>To the initiated few this sketch of a famous delineator of whimsicalities, with
the review of his works, times, and contemporaries, is offered with the conviction
that the intentions of the Author are not liable to be misconstrued by
them; nor has he any grounds to dread that the subjects represented run the
risk of being questioned at their hands on the grounds of propriety.</p>

<p>Fuller consideration is due to the many to whom the name of Rowlandson
conveys no more than a perception of 'oddity' or of license of treatment which
approaches vulgarity, to whom the innumerable inventions of the artist represent
foreign ground&mdash;a novel, strange land, populated with daring absurdities, according
to their theories.</p>

<p>It is felt that some justification is needed for the writer's temerity in volunteering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_viii" id="Page_i_viii">[viii]</a></span>
as a pioneer to conduct the unsophisticated through the devious and
eccentric intricacies which characterise the progress of pictorial satire, as demonstrated
in the subject of the work now submitted to the public with all due
deference.</p>

<p>The neophyte, it is anticipated, will be somewhat startled at the first glance
of the surroundings amidst which he will wander; but it is believed that, in the
course of his journey through an anomalous past, he will alight on discoveries,
more or less interesting in themselves, which provide abundant food for the
student of humanity.</p>

<p>The writer deprecates a hasty conclusion, with the assurance that those who
have the moderation to reserve their opinions until they have fully acquainted
themselves with the materials, may possibly suffer their critical instincts to be
modified in the process.</p>

<p>We have taken the liberty of scrutinising somewhat closely&mdash;with a view to
the portrayal of its salient features&mdash;a generation which was marked with a
colouring more intensified than those who live in our time are prepared to
adopt. Of this age, diversified with much which has been discarded, we accept
Rowlandson as the fitting exponent. His works epitomise a state of being
comparatively recent in actual fact, but, from the circumstances of change, so
distantly removed in appearance, as to constitute a curious experience to the
majority.</p>

<p>With every qualification to ensure success, Rowlandson, as his story indicates,
deliberately threw away the serious chances of life, to settle down as the
delineator of the transitory impressions of the hour. 'There is wisdom in
laughter,' says the sage; and&mdash;without precisely regarding life as a 'stale jest'&mdash;our
artist drew mirth from every situation, and illustrated from his own fecund
resources that, while nearly every circumstance has its grotesque as well as
its sinister aspect, the ludicrous elements of any given event are often more
enduring than the serious ones.</p>

<p>Good-natured pleasantry, we may remind the reader, is held to be wholesome.
Rowlandson's shafts, so far as our judgment serves, were never pointed
with gall: while he possessed the faculty of seizing the weak or ridiculous side
of his subject, he seems, unlike Gillray, his best-known contemporary, to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_ix" id="Page_i_ix">[ix]</a></span>
been an utter stranger to acrimonious instigations. A fuller acquaintanceship
reveals the Caricaturist&mdash;as he was described in his day&mdash;'an inexhaustible folio
of amusement, every page of which was replete with fun'&mdash;perhaps the most
genial travelling companion who could be selected in traversing the ways of
life led by our ancestors, for the half-century which witnessed the gradual
extinction of the quaint, old-fashioned Georgian era, and inaugurated the less
picturesque generation to which our immediate predecessors belong.</p>

<p>Be it recorded, concerning the part played in the world by the satirists,
pictorial and literal&mdash;'the less they deserve, the more merit in your bounty.'
We would modestly suggest the sapient axiom embodied by the great master,
'Fancy's favourite child,' relative to the transient jesters whose lot it has been
'to hold, as't were, the mirror up to nature' upon the mimic stage: 'Let them
be well used; for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time: after
your death you were better have a bad epitaph, than their ill report while you
live.'</p>

<h2><a name="ROWLANDSON_THE_CARICATURIST" id="ROWLANDSON_THE_CARICATURIST"></a><i>ROWLANDSON THE CARICATURIST.</i></h2>


<p>Buyers and readers of books, all admirers of pictures, drawings, and engravings&mdash;in
a word, the intelligent, and, let us hope, larger proportion of the community&mdash;are
well aware, if they are inclined to search for information
in respect to the celebrities of art, or would inquire into
the personal careers of the renowned pioneers and practitioners
of the serious branches of the profession, of whatever
period, school, or nationality, that numerous sources of
reference, tolerably easy of access, are open to the seeker
without being driven far abroad in his quest.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 165px;">
<img src="images/i_020.png" width="165" height="218" alt="" />
</div>

<p>There exist, as we are all thoroughly aware, abundant
lives of artists, dictionaries of painters, and other prolific
sources of information upon the practisers of the sober walks of pictorial art, with
rich collections of engravings from their works, in fact, a complete library of
delightful literature, which goes far towards proving that the world at least
acknowledges a slight interest in individuals as well as works, and that people
care to learn some particulars of the men who spent their industrious existences,
and devoted the gifts of their admitted genius and application to the humanising
walks of life, and to the fitting illustration of the world's universal passions and
history, or to the delineation of the ever-varying beauties of nature under
picturesque aspects.</p>

<p>Wealthy collectors, the cultivated patrons of material refinement, frequenters
of picture galleries, those who love pictures by instinct, art amateurs, and the
hopeful and fervent student, have alike a provision prepared for them in this
regard, which happily leaves little to be desired. The memoirs of artists&mdash;men
whose domestic and inner lives in so many instances teach lessons of gentleness,
simplicity, and singleness of purpose, of perseverance under difficulties; making
manifest to a world which is often slow to give them credit for the gifts that are
in them, the strong impulses of talent under untoward conditions&mdash;are, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_2" id="Page_i_2">[2]</a></span>
most part, tender memorials, labours of love, cherished productions of biographers,
whose own natural qualifications and trained appreciation of the subtler attractions
of art have brought them into more intimate communion with the memorable
subjects of their studies.</p>

<p>It has ever been a source of regret to the writer, since his youthful fancies
were first won by the marvels of grotesque art, and the pleasant creations of the
graphic humourists, that while the names of the designers, familiarly known as
<em>caricaturists</em>&mdash;who have enriched the more playful branches of the profession&mdash;are
household words, no fitting memorials are to be found of the careers of these
draughtsmen of true genius; they knew their generation, as is instanced in the
inexhaustible memorials they have bequeathed their descendants in their works,
and while they were themselves thoroughly familiar with the varied aspects and
workings of the social life with which they were surrounded, their generation
knew them not, and took no care to preserve any record of the capricious wits
whose pleasant inventions had
often afforded them enjoyment.
The humourists, who
did so much to contribute
towards the amusement of
others, have been suffered to
pass away, in too many cases,
as impersonalities. The works
of their fanciful and fertile imaginations
have been accepted
on all hands and allotted their
recognised position among the other agreeable accessories of life, while the
gifted professors have, with one or two notable exceptions, which make the reverse
the more marked, been pretty generally passed over, if they are thought of at all
under the relationship of realistic characters, as mythical beings, less tangible&mdash;as
regards their connection with the living people of their generations, of whose
persons, habits, and follies they have bequeathed animated instances to posterity&mdash;than
the most weird and fantastic creations of their own pencils or etching-points,
emanations of the mind, whose utmost substance amounts to paper, and
printing-ink, and ideas.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 365px;">
<img src="images/i_021.png" width="365" height="225" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The whimsical conceptions which owe their origin to Gillray, Rowlandson,
Bunbury, Ramberg, Woodward, Dighton, Nixon, Newton, Boyne, Collings,
Kingsbury, Isaac Cruikshank, his son, 'the glorious George,' the veteran calcographist,
who has just passed away full of years and reputation, Lane, Heath,
Seymour, and a bevy of their contemporaries, were in their day tolerably familiar,
their etchings and sketches were in the hands of the print-buying public of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_3" id="Page_i_3">[3]</a></span>
period, and they enjoy, as far as these relics of the past are concerned, a posthumous
reputation which varies according to the merits of their productions, a generation
or two having assigned them their just relative positions on the ladder of fame;
all the inimitable amusing travesties which reproduce the manners, and even the
sentiments of past celebrities and perished generations, owe their creation to
artists who were suffered to labour in partial obscurity; while the creatures of
their brains were in the hands of every one, their contemporaries, for the most
part, did not trouble themselves sufficiently to reflect whether the designers had
any real existence, possibly classing the actual, practical, living, and working men
under the category of abstract ideas in their own minds, impalpable atomies,
less substantial than their tangible satirical pictures, which enjoyed a popular
circulation.</p>

<p>The late Thomas Wright, F.S.A. (with the collaboration of an earnest worker
in the same field, the late F. W.
Fairholt, F.S.A., who contributed the
valuable aid of his pencil), has done
a great deal for the subject in his
'History of the Grotesque in Literature
and Art,' and still more in his
'Caricature History of the Three
Georges.' 'The Caricature History
of the Fourth George,' which offers
a still wider field of selection, as regards
political and pictorial squibs
and satires, has yet to appear.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 294px;">
<img src="images/i_022.png" width="294" height="269" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A preliminary contribution to the
history of caricature, as an attempt to repair in some measure the oversight of
indifferent contemporaries, 'The Works of James Gillray the Caricaturist, with
the Story of his Life and Times,' published under the auspices of Messrs.
Chatto and Windus, has already met with a favourable reception at the hands
of the press and the public; the present writer devoted several years to the
completion of the volume, with the solitary end in view of associating the artist
more intimately with his works, in the estimation of the public, before it was too
late. Mr. Thomas Wright, as an indefatigable pioneer in a comparatively
unbeaten track, deserved personal recognition on the strength of his important
contributions, bearing on the political history of the House of Hanover, as
duly set forth in the present writer's introduction, and to his name was offered
such repute as was conferred by the editorship.</p>

<p>The writer, from his gleanings in the same direction, has been able to offer
the public a sketch of the 'Life of Henry Bunbury the Caricaturist,' with slighter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_4" id="Page_i_4">[4]</a></span>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">croquis</i> of his contemporaries. During the interval since the first intention of
compiling the present volume as a further contribution to the literature of caricature
assumed a definite form, some ten years back, the preparation of the work, imperfect
and incomplete as it confessedly must remain&mdash;a mere <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&eacute;bauche</i> at best&mdash;has
been proceeding by slow and toilsome stages, the self-imposed task being rendered
a more difficult one than in the instance of James Gillray,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> from the disheartening
circumstance that it is utterly impossible to arrive at anything approaching a
comprehensive view of the works of Rowlandson; no adequate collection being
in existence, as far as the writer has discovered, with the possible exception of
an accumulation in the hands of Mr. Harvey of St. James's Street, the advantages
of which gathering (it has been going on steadily for years) have hitherto remained
inaccessible to the editor, the possessor's time having been too occupied by the
requirements of his other engagements to permit him to arrange the prints as he
wishes. This circumstance is to be regretted, since Mr. Harvey admits the
personal interest he feels in caricature,
upon which, when communicatively
inclined, he is able to
furnish very valuable information,
in part the results of his own
wide experience as a purchaser,
and still more, perhaps, of painstaking
investigations conducted
for his private delectation; as
his position and opportunities
enable him to gratify his tastes in
this direction to the fullest extent, it is hinted that on occasions he may feel
disposed to furnish the critic with certain valuable facts of a special nature, drawn
from the results of his own practical investigations in directions not generally
available. This gentleman is, undoubtedly, an authority, and as, it is believed,
he possesses unrivalled opportunities for forming a unique collection of prints by
any master whose works he may fancy, the writer has, from season to season for
the past six years, deferred the completion of his volume on the faith of a
generous-sounding promise that he should be allowed to consult Mr. Harvey's
collection of prints by Rowlandson, which, according to his knowledge, must be
both interesting and valuable, and may possibly contain a great deal that has
escaped his previous researches, however zealously they may have been instituted.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 324px;">
<img src="images/i_023.png" width="324" height="225" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The sacrifice of time, labour, and patience involved in attempting to compile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_5" id="Page_i_5">[5]</a></span>
anything approaching a fairly compendious summary of Rowlandson's etchings is
simply incredible. The desire to furnish a complete catalogue, though seemingly
reasonable in itself at the first glance, is discovered upon experience to be practically
impossible, and hence out of the question as regards arrangement; the
productions of the artist, multiplied by pen, graver, and etching-point, as supplied
by the hand of the master, or reproduced by other engravers, are legion, and
where the examples are scattered no amount of application can adequately
ascertain.</p>

<p>As far as kindly assistance is concerned, the writer has to acknowledge, with
sincere gratitude, that where his previous experience has taught him to anticipate
courtesies, he has been gratified in the highest degree, and he is proud to record
that he once more finds himself indebted for cordial sympathy to the best qualified
experts of the day.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 278px;">
<img src="images/i_024.png" width="278" height="204" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Mr. G. W. Reid,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the respected keeper of the prints and drawings in the
British Museum, with Messrs. Fagan and Donaghue, urbane members of his staff,
have at all times made his access easy to
the invaluable collection of social and
political caricatures in his department;
Mr. George Bullen (whose affability and
scholarly acquirements are proverbial),
the respected keeper of the printed books
in the same magnificent national institution,
has been able to facilitate the writer's
quest of illustrations and caricatures by
Rowlandson, so far as they come within
the scope of the important department which that gentleman so efficiently administers;
the obliging and accomplished custodian of the superb collection
belonging to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bibliothèque Nationale</i> of France has most readily allowed the
writer to avail himself of the select and valuable gathering of caricatures by
Rowlandson, which are to be found under his charge. It must be mentioned
that the caricature resources of the royal collection in the museum at Brussels
were as courteously placed at his service by the well-informed custodian, who, it
may be added, takes a considerable individual interest in this branch as illustrative
of men and manners under special aspects. The writer has pursued his perquisitions
as far as the national state collection of engravings contained in the
Trippenhuizen Museum, Amsterdam. These magnificent national institutions
are all, more or less, rich in caricatures of an historical description, but unfortunately,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_6" id="Page_i_6">[6]</a></span>
as regards the success of the present undertaking, the works of Rowlandson,
numerous as they are, happen to be the reverse of the strong features of their
collections of satirical prints, either political or social. The writer has accordingly
been thrown back, to a dispiriting extent, on his own necessarily restricted resources;
and the numerous illustrations which accompany this volume are for
the most part unavoidably drawn from his own folios.</p>

<p>The principal source from whence it was hoped the best information could
be detached proved utterly and exceptionally valueless; the writer refers to the
important publishing establishments (and the successors who carry on the firms
at the present day), whence the far-famed caricatures were originally issued. The
firms of the Humphries, Hollands, Jackson, J. R. Smith, and others under whose
auspices the artist's earliest, and in several instances most finished and ambitious
works, first secured their lasting reputation, have long become extinct, as far as
the editor is informed. But three leading print-publishing houses, established
by Rowlandson's principal patrons, to whom the publication of the major part of
his works was due, are still flourishing, under conditions modified to harmonise
with the requirements of the present age, by descendants
and successors of the well-known founders. These resources
have proved, however, a disappointing failure,
as far as assistance towards the compilation of a catalogue
of the artist's productions is concerned. To Mr.
Rudolph Ackermann, the respected inaugurator of the
'Repository of Arts,' a truly liberal and enterprising
gentleman, who will be referred to at greater length in
the course of this volume, Rowlandson (with many other professional artists and
authors) was deeply indebted both for business-like co-operation, for the pains he
took to sell the artist's countless original drawings, for personal encouragement,
untiring friendship, and pecuniary accommodation. Messrs. Ackermann
have unfortunately preserved no account of the numerous publications due to
the hand of the caricaturist, and issued for half-a-century by their respected
firm, nor have they any collection of impressions from the plates they gave to
the public.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 205px;">
<img src="images/i_025.png" width="205" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The same observation applies to Mr. William Tegg, whose father, the
indefatigable and well-known Thomas Tegg of Cheapside, published hundreds
of the satirist's later and cruder caricatures, which were more generally familiar
in the windows of printsellers, &amp;c., since copies were multiplied to a larger extent
than was practicable in the case of delicately finished aquatints, which gave
fewer impressions, and commanded higher prices. Consequently, Rowlandson
is better known to the public by his least desirable prints, and under his most
common-place aspect. Mr. S. W. Fores seems to have issued an important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_7" id="Page_i_7">[7]</a></span>
proportion of Rowlandson's larger and more valuable plates, with the addition
of an immense number of small subjects etched by Rowlandson, and finished by
clever aquatinters, published in a more costly form than was generally the custom
of the time. The successors of this gentleman have mentioned that the firm has
not preserved any list of the publications issued under its original and well-recognised
standing, in respect to satirical production, as <em>Fores' Caricature
Museum</em>, but it is understood that, at
the present writing, there still remains
in the house a collection, in huge
volumes, of early impressions from the
multitudinous plates issued from the
establishment under its earlier auspices&mdash;a
publisher's summary, in short, such
as, it is to be regretted, is rarely preserved for any length of time. Unfortunately,
owing to the exigencies of their modern print business, the writer has not
been permitted to consult this highly interesting collection; he has, however,
been informed, as an equivocal sort of consolation for his discomfiture, by the
member of the firm to whom his application was addressed, that the major
part of the prints, as far as the works of Rowlandson are concerned, are of
a political character, and that the interesting and valuable social engravings
are wanting; he also learns that nothing of importance by Rowlandson is to be
found in this collection.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 301px;">
<img src="images/i_026a.png" width="301" height="159" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 169px;">
<img src="images/i_026b.png" width="169" height="205" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It is worthy of note, that the majority of the caricatures described in the present
work, as published by S. W. Fores, belong almost entirely to the more attractive
order of social satires, and pictorial skits at home and abroad, or cartoons levelled
at the leaders of fashion, holding up the prevalent follies of the hour to legitimate
ridicule. The writer confesses that he is inclined to feel a
deeper regret at his inability to describe these political prints,
presuming his informant, who certainly ought to know, is
correct in this conclusion, since he is unable to account for
their existence, as amongst the immense number of caricatures
published by S. W. Fores, he has not hitherto lighted
upon the series in question. Rowlandson's political prints&mdash;which,
as the reader will realise in the progress of this
compilation, are numerous enough in all conscience&mdash;were mostly published, as
regards the early examples, by Humphries (a few of the somewhat hackneyed
Westminster Election set, 1784, were due to S. W. Fores, it is acknowledged);
while his later productions in this field, such as the succession of plates attacking
Buonaparte, were issued from Ackermann's Repository of Arts, or circulated by
Thomas Tegg (like the series treating of that <cite>Delicate Investigation</cite>, the Clarke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_8" id="Page_i_8">[8]</a></span>
scandal), according to the circumstances of the artist's employment or the cost of
the plates. Popular prices being a requisition in the case of the sets published
from the City, a coarser method of execution, with unmistakable instances of haste,
detract in an unqualified degree from the interest of these prints, as instances of
the artist's ability, which is exhibited to greater advantage in productions where
his skill was allowed a more liberal exercise, as is evidenced in the capitally
executed plates published by the West End print-selling firms.</p>

<p>The hopeful chances of aid from fountain-heads, upon experience, diminished
to zero; and, while obstacles multiplied, the writer found it necessary to redouble
his energy. As it proved that his own collection must, in the end, serve as the
main source of reliance, fresh efforts were made to increase his gathering, and
valuable additions were gradually secured. The process was somewhat tedious
and costly withal, but it was the only course left open, unless the intention was
renounced after the work had been advertised
in progress.</p>

<p>Print-sellers' shops, at home and abroad,
were ransacked, and auctions of engravings
were attended, whenever the alluring word
<em>caricatures</em> occurred in the catalogue. The
supply was remarkably limited, the demand
considerable and increasing; and
prices, from the nature of the request,
shortly became unreasonable. Choice
caricatures, or those in fairly good condition,
were pushed up to nearly the prices
of the original drawings, and even at these
enhanced rates but few examples were
forthcoming. In Paris, Brussels, and London, a five-pound note became about
a fair equivalent for a moderately fine impression after Rowlandson, if the plate
were large and the subject important or curious, while for certain of the more
sought-after examples, this rate was doubled; for such plates as <cite>Vauxhall
Gardens</cite>, dealers expect a still larger price&mdash;indeed, five-and-twenty pounds have
been demanded in many instances. The chances of fresh examples by Rowlandson
coming into the market have decreased, and possibly the competition will
relax when there is no longer a chance of exciting it.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 284px;">
<img src="images/i_027.png" width="284" height="300" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The writer has necessarily made the acquaintance of several gentlemen who
are fervent collectors of Rowlandson's works, and he by no means ignores his
obligations to those happy possessors of rarer specimens, who have frequently
carried them off with an air of conquest from discomfited rival amateurs, the
condition of their purses, and the artistic enthusiasm aroused at the moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_9" id="Page_i_9">[9]</a></span>
rendering similar triumphs comparatively facile, when incidental questions as to
actual worth are too insignificant to engage the attention.</p>

<p>Certain collectors of eminence, who are discriminating selectors of caricatures,
well qualified to judge of their technical merits, and who, further, are well posted
up in curious and out-of-the-way points of the political
and social histories of the times thus illustrated,
have volunteered the results of their researches;
these good-natured offers have arrived too late to
be available, but the writer is not the less indebted
to the kindness which prompted the action; in an
earlier and preparatory stage, these advances would
have been of considerable value and assistance.</p>

<p>So much for the materials; perhaps too much
stress has been laid, as far as the reader's patience
is concerned, on the preliminary difficulties which
have hindered and weakened the execution of the
writer's desire to reproduce, by pencil and pen, a fair
gathering of the works of our greatest humorous designers, an idea long
cherished, and tardily carried out, as regards the first part of his task,
<em>James Gillray</em>; and beset, as he has recounted, in respect to <span class="smcap">Thomas
Rowlandson</span>, the concluding portion, by unforeseen impediments and technical
difficulties which it would be tedious to enumerate; they may, however,
in a minor degree, be taken into consideration as a plea for the obvious
shortcomings of this laborious compilation, and, while inclining rigid specialists
to be less exacting, induce critics to regard the unavoidable faults of the
performance with lenient
forbearance.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 401px;">
<img src="images/i_028b.png" width="401" height="234" alt="" />
</div>

<p>For the space of a
century, Rowlandson's caricatures,
which are more
properly <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">croquis</i> of the life
which surrounded him, have
continued to afford delight
to the appreciators of graphic
humour, from the date,
1775, when he sent his first
contribution to the Royal Academy. It was only this year (1878) that
a pair of his remarkably spirited drawings, <cite>Faro Table at Devonshire House</cite>,
and <cite>A Gaming Table</cite>, attracted considerable praise and attention on the
walls of the Grosvenor Gallery. Although the artist was master of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_10" id="Page_i_10">[10]</a></span>
elegant refinement, both of delineation and colouring, and produced the most
delicious female heads with that lightness and daintiness of touch which was his
peculiar gift, bringing all the graces, sparkle and animation of the French school
to bear upon the models of winsome female beauty our own favoured isles produced
for the exercise of his pencil, we are constrained to admit, thus early
in our summary, that too many of his productions are strongly tinctured by
that coarseness of subject and sentiment which has been held to disfigure
the works of contemporary humorists; his wit, it must be remembered, was
of the jocose school of Smollett and Fielding, and in justice it must be taken
into consideration that his designs, even in their most uncompromising and
grosser aspects, simply reflect the colour of a period which was the reverse of
squeamish, and, as has been pertinently observed by the late Thomas Wright,
'of a generation celebrated for anything rather than delicacy.'</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 323px;">
<img src="images/i_029.png" width="323" height="252" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The artist was pretty generally
recognised as the famous
illustrator of <cite>Doctor Syntax</cite> and
<cite>The Dance of Death</cite>, and in this
relation he is fairly acknowledged
by posterity; this limited view,
as the present volume is designed
to demonstrate, being far indeed
from an adequate acknowledgment
of his proper artistic standing.
Rowlandson's higher qualifications,
as a draughtsman in
water-colours of remarkable
merit, a portrait-painter of felicitous promise, and the originator of countless
witty and pointed conceptions, were discovered more tardily. His surprising
facility for representing the human figure, with knowledge and freedom of
execution, his marvellous power of combining groups and crowds of figures in
active movement, his grasp of expression, and fluency of colour and handling,
were more particularly admitted (though in a sense they have since been lost
sight of) after the Exhibition of 1862, where two of his truly characteristic
subjects, of considerable size, made their appearance on the walls, to the amazement
and delight of the spectators, who had no previous acquaintance with his
whimsical genius. These two drawings, which opened the eyes of the world to
his gifts for a little season, are entitled <cite>An English Review</cite> and <cite>A French
Review</cite>; they originally formed a very noticeable feature on the walls of the
Royal Academy in 1786; it is believed that eventually they came into the possession
of the Prince of Wales, and, with the rest of George IV.'s collection, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_11" id="Page_i_11">[11]</a></span>
remained in keeping of the royal family ever since, her gracious Majesty, the
Queen, being pleased to lend them, with other fine representative examples of
art, to the Exhibition Commissioners of 1862.</p>

<p>The <cite>English Review</cite>, and its companion drawing, a <cite>French Review</cite>, hang at
Windsor Castle, where we are informed there is a very large accumulation of
caricatures, drawings and prints, put away in a closet, in the order of their appearance;
which, it is likely, have remained undisturbed for generations. It is
not impossible that, hidden away in this mass of satirical productions, may be
found the series of drawings, notoriously of a free tendency as regards subject,
which Rowlandson is understood to have produced for the delectation of George
IV. A collection of a similar description was, as we learn from the same
authority, destroyed by a nobleman well known for his princely liberality, on the
death of the patron who had selected the subjects.</p>

<p>In the unrivalled collection of water-colour drawings of the English school,
which are found on the walls of the sumptuous
permanent Museum of Art at South Kensington,
are exhibited three characteristic examples of Rowlandson's
talents in the caricature direction. <cite>The
Parish Vestry</cite>, 1784, a humorous and spirited
drawing, belonging to the artist's best time, formed
part of the munificent gift made by Mr. William
Smith to the nation; as did the second example,
entitled <cite>Brook Green Fair</cite>, which we should assign
to about the year 1800. The third drawing, representing
<cite>The old Elephant and Castle Inn,
Newington</cite>, is also due to a liberal donor, being the gift of G. W. Atkinson, Esq.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 228px;">
<img src="images/i_030.png" width="228" height="264" alt="" />
</div>

<p>As has been related, the caricaturist produced thousands of capital drawings,
delicately tinted, excelling in all styles; and from these original designs, he
executed in turn thousands of spirited etchings with his own hand, which were
frequently coloured to reproduce the first sketches, or aquatinted by engravers
(sometimes by himself), in imitation of drawings tenderly shaded in Indian ink, to
which, in some instances, the resemblance is sufficiently faithful to deceive the
eye of anyone who is not familiar with this method of reproduction.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind&mdash;and we insist the more earnestly on this point, as,
from some incomprehensible wilfulness, it has seemingly been suffered to sink
out of sight for a time&mdash;in treating of Rowlandson, that the man was essentially
an artist; it is undoubtedly true that he was gifted (perhaps we might consider
fatally as far as his proper estimation is concerned) with the faculty known as
<em>caricature</em>, and he excelled in burlesque, but his successes were sufficiently high
in other branches of the artist's profession to indicate that he was equally qualified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_12" id="Page_i_12">[12]</a></span>
by original talents, by academic training which he might have turned to the
best advantage, by a sense of the beautiful unusually keen, and a happy power of
expressing his first impressions, to take a foremost place amongst the best recognised
masters of the early English school, to whose body he might have been an
ornament, if he had not preferred his chosen calling of 'a free-lance' with a roving
commission to work mischief. His remarkable gifts of originality, ever fertile,
and apparently exhaustless, and facile powers of invention, either pleasant or
terrific, which seemed spontaneous, were in his case insurmountable hindrances,
instead of promoting his advancement and reputation as a painter of acknowledged
value and eminence. He had the calamity&mdash;so fatal, in his and many other instances,
to serious application&mdash;to succeed without sensible effort; from the very
first his progress was a series of triumphs; none of the students of the Academy
could draw such ludicrous and yet life-like figures, and thus his popularity with
his fellow-labourers was assured; his studies from the nude, both in London and
in Paris, were wonderful for the rapid ease and talent with which they were
executed, and hence arose another source of glorification, and although personal
vanity has never been mentioned in connection with the artist (he being
thoroughly blind to everything but his own particular hobbies), the professors at
home and abroad, and the members of the Academy themselves, were proud to
patronise in their classes such precocious ability, which could accomplish the
most difficult delineations without effort, and thus reflected credit on their
schools; and the prodigy who drew from the life, in his youth, as vigorously and
well as the most painstaking adepts in their maturity, could not fail to receive a
dangerous amount of admiration, which tempted him to depend upon trifling
exertions, and left his ambition without a spur.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/i_031.png" width="480" height="215" alt="" />
</div>

<p>While yet in his boyhood he was recognised as a genius, and was unhappily
flattered into becoming a wayward one; the very fluency of his pencil, and the
fidelity of his memory towards the grotesque side of things proved his stumbling-blocks.
It is with more than a passing shade of regret that we reflect, with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_13" id="Page_i_13">[13]</a></span>
far-seeing colleagues at the Academy and elsewhere, how eminent a painter was
lost in the development of a <em>caricaturist</em>, admirable and unsurpassed in his own
branch as Rowlandson must admittedly remain. The gifts which were in the
man were marvellous, and beyond this he possessed nerve to persevere, and
manly resolution to sustain his exertions, as he proved in his youth, and subsequently
demonstrated when past life's meridian, times then being less prosperous,
since fortunes and legacies had long ceased to fall in adventitiously, but the very
excitement of setting the little world wondering, and making the public smile, while
his tickled audience accorded him the cheapest popularity by crowding in admiration
round his travesties, turned the wilful artist away from serious application,
where no immediate fun was to be secured for either the limner or his following.</p>

<p>Rowlandson's sense of feminine loveliness, of irresistible graces of face, expression,
and attitude, was unequalled in its way; several of his female portraits
have been mistaken for sketches by Gainsborough or Moreland, and as such, it is
possible, since the caricaturist is so little
known in this branch, that many continue to
pass current. From 1777 to 1781, five years
of Rowlandson's residence in Wardour Street,
with all the freshness of his academic studies,
and the laurels unfaded he had won in the
schools, with golden opinions, as a youth of
paramount promise, indulged by the most
eminent of the Royal Academicians and the
French professors, the artist practised the
more laborious and prosaic, but surer branch of
portrait-painting with success, and his pictures
were duly received by his patrons and well-wishers amongst the omnipotent
Forty, and found their place on the walls of the Royal Academy Exhibition
without a break&mdash;no barren compliment when it is remembered that his compeers
were Reynolds, Gainsborough, and Hoppner, and that of the two or three
hundred works selected for the gallery at the period referred to, the superb
canvases of the artists named constituted an average of over ten per cent. of the
entire exhibits.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 260px;">
<img src="images/i_032.png" width="260" height="258" alt="" />
</div>

<p>If we but think for a passing instant over the winsome portraitures of fair
women, whose faces live, for the delectation of all time, on the canvases of Sir
Joshua Reynolds, Gainsborough, Romney, and a few lesser luminaries, it is cruel
to realise that Rowlandson, from sheer wantonness (promoted by what seemed a
happy hit in 1784),<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> neglected his opportunities in the direction of portraiture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_14" id="Page_i_14">[14]</a></span>
with an indifference which, while proving his disinterestedness and superiority to
mere profit, is the more exasperating when we are frequently told, as every one
of Rowlandson's contemporaries who has mentioned the caricaturist never fails
to reiterate, that the successive presidents of the Royal Academy, the great
Reynolds, the royally patronised West, the courtly and fashionable Lawrence,
the very men we have mentioned who were, it must be conceded, the most competent
judges on the point, pronounced their conviction that his abilities entitled
to acceptance, as one of themselves, a brother artist whose addition to their ranks
they would have gloried to acknowledge, since he had the undoubted genius to
reflect a lustre on the Academy, if he had exerted his talents in the recognised
channels, and withstood the impulse of his notoriety for producing irresistibly
droll novelties, which, as they foresaw, must infallibly prove pernicious to the
practice of sober portraiture.</p>

<p>The versatile acquirements of our artist may, in a sense, be looked upon as
an infirmity, a theory which
had been thoroughly established
while the subject of it
remained in the flesh, and enjoyed
a certain perverse gratification
in contributing to support
its soundness and perspicacity.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 343px;">
<img src="images/i_033.png" width="343" height="260" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In landscape art we discover
Rowlandson successfully
rivalling the most respected
practitioners in water-colours
amongst his contemporaries,
and helping the younger professional generation, that carried the art to perfection,
to discard the obsolete theories of blackness for clear translucid colouring. His
studies after nature are much esteemed, and are to be occasionally recognised in
galleries and collections. It is a sufficiently capricious circumstance which has
come within our experience&mdash;we have heard it asserted confidently more than
once&mdash;that Rowlandson, the simple harmonious colourist and ready draughtsman,
whose brush with limpid tints so deftly translated on paper the charms of sylvan
scenes; the truthful artist who pictured the forest, fall, and glade, the distant
hamlets amidst the foliage, the picturesque windings of the silver stream, the
rustic cottages, the cattle wending leisurely through the fertile pastures, the
mellow atmosphere, and the far-extending horizon, is often held a distinct individual
from that other universally known Rowlandson&mdash;of equivocal reputation,
it is hinted&mdash;whose daring reed-pen produced grotesques which perhaps were
inimitable, but which, it is certain, were often indefensibly vulgar.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_15" id="Page_i_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>The artist's facility was so considerable that, had he been less scrupulous (his
horror of fraud and imposition, especially in their pecuniary reference, was implacable,
in spite of, or perhaps in contradistinction to, his other levities), he could
have allowed his own productions, in the manner of his reputable contemporaries,
and even of deceased celebrities, whose subjects and method he chose to imitate
as a question of pure ingenuity&mdash;(while his own style is above all difficult to reproduce)&mdash;to
pass current as veritable originals by the masters. A book of
etchings consisting entirely of these imitations is described in the course of this
work, and he has managed to assume, without copying any particular picture, the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</i> of the artists, and has varied his own manner of execution and
disguised his salient individualities with such subtlety, that, even to the etching-point,
slight trace of Rowlandson remains to betray the acknowledged imposition.</p>

<p>In his sketches after nature, as we have ventured to advance in respect to his
female portraits and delicious studies from life, in many instances it is difficult to
distinguish between the artless rustic groupings and charming pastoral drawings
by George Moreland and Thomas Gainsborough, let alone those of Barrett, Hills,
Howitt, Pugh, and other of his associates (who executed pictures lightly outlined
with a reed-pen, shaded with a warm tint and delicately washed with transparent
water-colours, as was then the process),<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and the acknowledged contributions of
our versatile genius to this department, in the earlier stages of the captivating
art of water-colour drawing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 495px;">
<img src="images/i_034.png" width="495" height="175" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The writer, in the course of his preparation for this work, has been at the
pains to consult more than one well-recognised artist of reputation and authority;
seeking for hints from professors whose celebrity extended well back towards the
beginning of the nineteenth century; these respected ancients, who are now
nearly all gathered to the shades to join the subject of this volume, being from
their age, knowledge, and experience, as well as from the traditions of their
earlier masters, most likely to know and remember circumstances of a special
character bearing upon the subject. Some of these worthies were actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_16" id="Page_i_16">[16]</a></span>
working as contemporaries of the caricaturist who departed fifty years ago. The
last time the writer met George Cruikshank, a few months before that truly
splendid old gentleman passed away, full of years and honour, to his well-earned
repose, he took occasion to allude to the veteran's acknowledged admiration for
the works of his extraordinarily endowed predecessor, James Gillray, in whose
footsteps he had very literally commenced his career, being selected during the
lifetime of the gifted caricaturist (when Gillray's genius had proved too exacting
for the tension of his faculties, and his reason had unhappily departed, never to
be restored beyond an occasional lucid flitter) to complete several plates which
the attacks of his malady had suspended. George Cruikshank, the most deservedly
popular of the name, was not a little proud of having been thought worthy,
while still a very young man (Gillray's faculties were deranged in 1811), to take
up the plates of the first genius that has adorned his art. With the earnestness
of his disposition, and perhaps with characteristic partiality, he regarded the unfortunate
Gillray as the greatest man, in his eyes, who ever lived, indisputably
'the prince of caricaturists,' as he has appropriately christened him, and this title,
won from a loving disciple, who, in
his turn, became still more famous,
is likely to last as long as the great
caricaturist is remembered.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 334px;">
<img src="images/i_035.png" width="334" height="172" alt="" />
</div>

<p>George Cruikshank voluntarily
called on the writer to express the
interest he good-naturedly felt in
certain slight records of past caricaturists
then publishing, and to communicate some valuable facts about the
works of his father, a meritorious artist whose reputation would be widely
increased if his pictures, exhibited at the Royal Academy, were better known.
On a subsequent occasion the cheery veteran imparted various anecdotes on the
subject within his knowledge, but confessed that he had never been admitted to
terms of personal familiarity with either Gillray or Rowlandson in the flesh.
It was his father, Isaac Cruikshank&mdash;for whose graphic powers in the same
walk he expressed the best deserved and truest filial respect&mdash;who enjoyed
their intimacy, and it was he who related (with a genial force happily done
justice to by his descendant) to his deeply interested son the circumstances with
which George was acquainted.</p>

<p>The writer was naturally eager to gather, while there was yet time, any facts
which might be of importance for the furtherance of his contemplated sketch of
Rowlandson's career, which was then occupying all his energies, from the last
representative of the famous caricaturists, who formed, in himself, so desirable a
link with the generation of the Georgian epoch, which had been dissolved into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_17" id="Page_i_17">[17]</a></span>
the thinnest elements for three-fourths of a century back. Cruikshank expressed
the most cordial interest in the undertaking, and genially declared, by way of an
encouragement, which is the writer's most appreciated reward, that he should
look forward to its successful completion, and further promised that if, in revising
his notes, and the personal memoirs, touching upon such kindred topics (which,
as he imparted, had long employed his leisure), he could discover any allusions of
an interesting description to his gifted contemporary Rowlandson, or any similar
memoranda left by his father, he would communicate them for the benefit of the
present volume. His death has unfortunately prevented the accomplishment of
this valued service, which was volunteered spontaneously with his well-known
readiness to confer favours.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 440px;">

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 455px;">
<img src="images/i_036b.png" width="455" height="280" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The point about Rowlandson which had most impressed George Cruikshank
is somewhat original, and properly belongs to this part of our subject; hence we
have been glad to have an opportunity of quoting the trustworthy authority of
the aged caricaturist. 'Rowlandson,' said George, 'was a remarkable man in
most respects;' the waywardness of his youth and the notoriety of his gambling
days seemed to have rather prejudicially influenced the mind of his simpler
successor, who had taken his place in 1827, as he had, almost of right, succeeded
to the working-table and unfinished plates of James Gillray, many years before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_18" id="Page_i_18">[18]</a></span>
Cruikshank, moreover, considered that Rowlandson's academical successes, his
successful rivalry of Mortimer in depicting the nude, the knowledge of his art
and the fluency he had acquired, were altogether exceptional features in the
profession of a caricaturist, to his English views; but, according to his kindly
creed, mellowed by age&mdash;his steel a trifle tempered since his own youth, when
his shafts too were not without poignancy&mdash;'Rolley' was somewhat unreflecting,
and reckless in exposing the infirmities of others, having but scant regard for his
own reputation or the feelings of society, and further he had suffered himself to
be led away from the exercise of his legitimate subjects, to produce works of a
reprehensible tendency, which respectable dictum will probably find numerous
subscribers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="SHIPPING_SCENE"></a><img src="images/i_037.jpg" width="600" height="335" alt="" />
<div class="caption">A SHIPPING SCENE.</div>
</div>

<p>Strangely as it may sound, it was not as a caricaturist that Rowlandson had
gained Cruikshank's admiration; he appreciated the artist enthusiastically as an
accomplished water-colour painter, the equal in his opinion of most of the founders
of our special school. Rowlandson's masterly power over the delineation of the
figure, and his happy gift, amounting almost to inspiration, of portraying female
charms of face and person, deserved high regard in Cruikshank's estimation; his
peculiarly felicitous pictures of quaint Continental life, and the examples his free
and scholarly handling held out, as admirable models of style to the French caricaturists
of his day; the social sketches produced in Paris at the beginning of the
century, though remarkable for neatness and delicacy, being laborious, formal,
timid, and wanting in that racy comicality, and dashing power of expression,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_19" id="Page_i_19">[19]</a></span>
characterising the drawings under consideration, to which George accorded unqualified
praise.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 260px;">

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_038b.jpg" width="300" height="319" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It was chiefly for his skill in landscape delineation that Cruikshank respected
the artist under discussion, and more especially, as he declared, warming with his
reminiscences of the drawings he called to
mind, he had never seen anything superior,
in his estimation, to Rowlandson's water-side
and maritime sketches, for their clear freshness
and simple air of fidelity to nature;
the banks of the river, the 'pool' filled with
vessels, wharves, landing-places, ports, and
naval stations, with the noble men-of-war
lying off; and the bustling craft, travelling
between the fleet and the shore; the groups of busy figures, far and near,
happily introduced in a state of seeming activity; the shipping, which he drew
with picturesque ease and dexterity, his far-spreading landscapes and distant
horizons, the treatment of the water, the movement of his skies, and the general
sense of expanse and atmosphere, were beautiful in the extreme, all noted down,
as they were, without apparently a second thought, with the slightest possible
labour, recalling in a forcible degree the drawings of William Vandevelde, who
was, in Cruikshank's opinion, the only
artist whose marine studies could be
quoted in comparison with those of
Rowlandson.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a id="THE_QUAY"></a><img src="images/i_039.jpg" width="600" height="390" alt="" />
<div class="caption">THE QUAY.</div>
</div>

<p>We are necessarily anxious to
avoid the suspicion of attempting to
prove too much, and it must be admitted
that we do not pronounce
Rowlandson a Rubens, a William
Vandevelde, a Reynolds, and a Moreland,
all at once; any more than we
can be deluded into the belief that his
landscape drawings might be claimed
by Turner, Girtin, De Wint, Fielding,
or David Cox. In treating of our
artist in relation to the truly great
names which have been frequently put into contrast with his own, it must
not be forgotten that his works are spoken of, as they exist, under their
modest condition of sketches manipulated in the very slightest manner possible,
and, if considered at all in juxtaposition with those of the higher luminaries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_20" id="Page_i_20">[20]</a></span>
it is only by the side of studies executed under similar circumstances; it would
be a piece of pretension, entirely out of character on our part, to even suggest
submitting Rowlandson's attempts in the most respectable exercise of his
talents in competition with the more substantial finished and ambitious pictures
bequeathed us by the select few of really eminent painters, whose unrivalled
works cannot fail to afford the most unqualified delight to all cultivated lovers of
art of whatever school. <em>Their</em> productions are admitted to stand alone, even
though there exist diversities of opinion, schisms, and heresies in regard to the
generality of the profession.</p>

<p>In resuming our summary of Rowlandson's conceptions in the <em>caricature</em>
branch, we must notice, while contemplating his strongly characterised works,
that, while the rest of his competitors in the grotesque walk have in most examples
left no record of their prints beyond the plates on which they were
executed, for every subject he has produced of his own designing, at least one
corresponding drawing has existed, and frequently three or four variations of
leading ideas are worked out as completed pictures, without, however, any appearance
of experimentalising under difficulties of execution&mdash;technical points
never puzzled his skill; and such daring flights as Rubens ventured with the
brush, in the way of foreshortened and difficult attitudes, Rowlandson's reed-pen
accomplished right merrily, as if by its own volition, and without a thought on
the part of its highly-trained wielder, about such common-place requirements as
the posing of living models or preparatory sketches. The original notions of
Rowlandson's whimsical inventions are in the generality of instances far worthier
of attention than the most spirited etchings he thought fit to circulate after them;
and it is well to keep in mind that the artist has produced some thousands of
humorous conceptions (placing his more serious studies out of the question), of
which no engraving has ever appeared; and amongst these unpublished delineations
may be included several of the most ingenious and attractive pictures
executed by his hand, especially from the year 1790, that is to say, for more than
two-thirds of his professional life&mdash;a circumstance with which every collector of
original drawings by this artist is thoroughly conversant.</p>

<p>The career of Rowlandson may be divided into periods; the work belonging
properly to the several stages is tolerably distinctive as to general characteristics.
An adept can positively determine, within a year or two, the particular section
to which his designs, when the date happens to be wanting, may be justly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_22" id="Page_i_22">[22]</a></span>
assigned, and, as his manifold sketches and etchings extend over the space of
half a century, this circumstance is a trifle remarkable in itself.</p>

<p>The first period, as far as his published plates are concerned, includes his
smaller social and political satires; the execution, though free and fluent, as his
productions uniformly were, exhibits indications of care which is not so traceable
as his method grew mellower, and practice confirmed the facility which came to
him as a gift. These juvenile etchings bear more affinity to Gillray's manner of
manipulation than is traceable in his subsequent cartoons. A view of <cite>A Hazard
Table</cite> and its frequenters (<cite>E.O. or the fashionable Vowels</cite>, October 28, 1781)
offers perhaps the best indications of his growing powers, between 1774 and
1783. His publishers were Humphrey, Holland, Jackson, and a few others; and
he further appears, in conjunction with J. Jones, to have gone into the publishing
way himself, at 103 Wardour Street.</p>

</div>

<p>In 1784 the excitement of the famous Westminster Election seems to have
carried him more thoroughly into political
satires, and, as we observe, his humour
discovered an unflagging source of impulse
round the parliamentary candidates,
Fox, Wray, and Hood; the fair Duchess
of Devonshire, Lady Duncannon, and
honest Sam House, the Whig canvassers,
and their opponents on the ministerial
side, the Hon. Mrs. Hobart (Lady
Buckinghamshire), and the Duchess of
Gordon; together with the whimsicalities
of the polling-booth. If we were
asked to select his most noticeable social and satirical effusions, we should incline
to particularise <cite><a href="#CURIOSITY">English Curiosity</a>, or the Foreigner stared out of countenance</cite>;
1784, <cite>or the Fashions of the Day</cite>; and <cite>A Sketch from Nature</cite> (January 24, 1784).</p>

<p>In 1784, Rowlandson realised the full extent both of his powers of fancy and
his mastery of the art of water-colour delineation. He discontinued the practice
of sending portraits to the Exhibition of the Royal Academy, in which he had
persevered for five years, and contributed in their places three mirth-provoking
drawings, which must have produced no little sensation amongst the visitors,
who were unaccustomed to such works. These were the inimitable <cite>Vauxhall
Gardens</cite>, which reveals his talents at their best, <cite><a href="#ITALIAN">An Italian Family</a></cite>, and <cite>The
Serpentine River</cite>.</p>

<p>In 1785 appeared some of John Raphael Smith's graceful publications after
Rowlandson's more refined originals, notably <cite>Vauxhall</cite>, <cite><a href="#OPERA_BOXES">Opera Boxes</a></cite>, <cite>Toying
and Trifling</cite>, <cite><a href="#ITALIAN">An Italian Family</a></cite>, <cite>A French Family</cite>, <cite><a href="#GROG">Grog on Board</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#TEA">Tea on Shore</a></cite>; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_23" id="Page_i_23">[23]</a></span>
<cite>Filial Affection, or a Trip to Gretna Green</cite>; <a href="#RECONCILIATION"><cite>Reconciliation</cite></a>; <cite><a href="#INTRUSION">Intrusion
on Study</a>, or the Painter disturbed</cite>; <cite><a href="#COMFORT_IN_THE_GOUT">Comfort in the Gout</a></cite>; and several other excellent
subjects in his most finished manner, besides an animated scene after
Henry Wigstead, <cite>John Gilpin's Return to London</cite>.</p>

<p>Rowlandson sent five important and highly humorous drawings, displaying
advanced qualities in the direction of execution, to the Royal Academy in 1786;
those of the first consequence were <cite>An English Review</cite>, <cite>A French Review</cite>, the
pair exhibited at the International Exhibition 1862; <cite>Opera House Gallery</cite>, under
which designation, as we suspect, we recognise his <cite><a href="#BOX-LOBBY">Box Lobby Loungers</a></cite>, published
the very same year; <cite>A French Family</cite> (published the year previous); and <cite>A
Coffee House</cite>, of which we can discover no further record.</p>

<p>Among the engraved works for the same year we must refer to the print
of <cite><a href="#BOX-LOBBY">Box Lobby Loungers</a></cite>, already mentioned, and <cite><a href="#COVENT_GARDEN">Covent Garden Theatre</a></cite>, as the
most noticeable as to size, subject,
and the numerous figures introduced.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 329px;">
<img src="images/i_042.png" width="329" height="282" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Rowlandson sent four known
works to the Royal Academy, the
season following (1787). They were
<cite>French Barracks</cite>, a superlative drawing,
<cite><a href="#GROG">Grog on Board</a> a Ship</cite>, <cite>Countrymen
and Sharpers</cite> (engraved by
Sherwin as <cite><a href="#SMITHFIELD_SHARPERS">Smithfield Sharpers</a></cite>),
and <cite>The Morning Dram, or Huntsman
rising</cite>, engraved as <cite>Four o'clock
in the Country</cite>, S. W. Fores (October
20, 1790). All Rowlandson's contributions
for this year have been published; indeed, it is very possible, from
the popularity of the caricaturist's novel exhibits, that all the pictures he sent to
the Royal Academy were straightway issued on copper. There are two exceptions,
<cite>The Serpentine</cite> and <cite>A Coffee House</cite>, of which the writer has never succeeded
in meeting impressions, but it by no means follows that sooner or later
they may not come to light, and it does not seem unlikely that the first named,
<cite>The Serpentine River</cite>, may be another version of <cite>Cold Broth and Calamity</cite>
(published in 1792).</p>

<p>Amongst the engraved works of 1787, the writer instances <cite>Baron Ron's
Dental Surgery, or Transplanting of Teeth</cite>, and a series of five <cite>Hunting Scenes</cite>,
<cite>The Morning</cite>, <cite><a href="#THE_MEET">The Meet</a></cite>, <cite>The Run</cite>, <cite>The Death</cite>, and <cite>The Dinner</cite>, published in a
folio size, and now somewhat rarely met with as a set.</p>

<p>In the two succeeding years Rowlandson again threw his etching-point into
party conflicts, and came out with a shower of political squibs on the amenities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_24" id="Page_i_24">[24]</a></span>
of the <cite>Regency Struggle</cite>. Nothing very ambitious in the way of social satires
appeared in 1788. Among minor subjects we may allude to <cite><a href="#HOUSEBREAKERS">Housebreakers</a></cite>, <cite>A
Cart Race</cite>, <cite>The School for Scandal</cite>, <cite><a href="#FENCING">A Fencing Match</a></cite>, <cite>A Print Sale</cite>, <cite><a href="#LUST_AVARICE">Lust and
Avarice</a></cite>, and <cite><a href="#LUXURY_DESIRE">Luxury and Desire</a></cite>, as being slightly above the average. In 1789
and 1790 but few works of exceptional character were issued to gratify Rowlandson's
devoted admirers or the general public. <cite>She don't deserve it!</cite> <cite>Don't
he deserve it?</cite> <cite>A Racing Series</cite>, <cite><a href="#COURSE">The Course</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#BETTING">The Betting Post</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#MOUNT">The Mount</a></cite>, <cite><a href="#START">The
Start</a></cite>, and <cite>A Fresh Breeze</cite>, take the lead. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Place des Victoires à Paris</i>
belongs to 1789, and, in the writer's estimation, it is perhaps one of the most
attractive subjects due to the artist's pencil, exhibiting, as it does, the quaint
surroundings of Parisian life, as noted by the caricaturist before the Revolutionary
era&mdash;delineations of feminine beauty, and studies of real character, such as no
effort of the imagination could fabricate, unless assisted by travel, a familiar
acquaintance with the locality, and keen observation.
A fitting companion is given to
this delightful subject in another important
drawing, crowded with diversified life and
animated groups, produced in 1800; <cite>The
Thuilleries in Paris</cite>, a reminiscence of previous
studies in the French metropolis, of
manners noted anterior to the destruction of
antiquated fashions; the dainty <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belles</i> of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ton</i>,
and the picturesque society which might be
discovered flourishing under the reign of Louis
XVI., before the inauguration of the all-devouring
Republic, which worked more change
in a few feverish months of turbulence, in
which all the recognised phases of the past were lost, than many sober decades
had effected in their better regulated courses.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 254px;">
<img src="images/i_043.png" width="254" height="302" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The best of Rowlandson's publications for 1790 were <cite>A Kick-up at a Hazard
Table</cite>, in which, as may be supposed, he was perfectly at home; <cite>Four o'clock in
the Morning in Town</cite>, which was also in the artist's way, and its companion,
<cite>Four o'clock in the Morning in the Country</cite>; <cite>Frog-hunting</cite> (Gallic <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gourmets fins</i>),
and <cite><a href="#TYTHE">Tythe Pig</a></cite>, a fine old English equivalent.</p>

<p>The year 1791 was richer in those more ambitious plates, which the writer is
seeking to identify, and several of the caricaturist's choicer subjects appeared,
etched by his hand, and finished in aquatint, to facsimile the meritorious original
drawings. <cite>A Squall in Hyde Park</cite> is one of the score or two of delineations of
the highest type, which adequately demonstrate the exceptional qualifications
of the artist; and these, we have no hesitation in averring, have never been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_25" id="Page_i_25">[25]</a></span>
excelled in their walk, as far as executive ability, sense of loveliness, grouping,
movement, grasp of character, powers of observation, and diverting qualities are
concerned. Another remarkable subject of extraordinary ability, founded on
Rowlandson's Continental studies, entitled <cite>French Barracks</cite> (exhibited in 1787),
and its pendant, <cite><a href="#BARRACKS">English Barracks</a></cite>, were issued this year. <cite><a href="#INN_YARD">An Inn Yard on
Fire</a></cite>, belonging to the same important series; <cite>The Attack</cite>; <cite>The Prospect before
us</cite>; <cite>The Pantheon</cite>; <cite><a href="#CHAOS">Chaos is Come Again</a></cite>, in allusion to the dilapidated state of
Drury Lane theatre condemned by the surveyors; <cite>Toxophilites</cite>; <cite>House breakers</cite>;
<cite><a href="#SHEETS">Damp Sheets</a></cite> and <cite><a href="#SLUGS">Slugs in a Saw Pit</a></cite>, among the numerous lesser subjects,
bring up the total of the truly estimable works which gratified the public
in 1791.</p>

<p><cite>Cold Broth and Calamity</cite>, a skating scene representing disasters in the park,
from a ludicrous point of view; <cite>A Dutch Academy</cite>, drawn from the caricaturist's
experiences in the Netherlands; and <cite><a href="#GLUTTONS">Studious Gluttons</a></cite> were the leading plates
published in 1792.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 249px;">
<img src="images/i_044.png" width="249" height="286" alt="" />
</div>

<p><cite>New Shoes</cite>, a small, but delicate subject, belongs
to 1793.</p>

<p>In 1797 appeared the admirable plates published
after Rowlandson's studies in the Netherlands;
we cannot too highly commend such inimitable
originals as <cite>Fyge Dam, Amsterdam</cite>; <cite>Stadt
House, Amsterdam</cite>; <cite>Companion View, Amsterdam</cite>;
and <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place de Mer, Antwerp</cite>.</p>

<p><cite>Admiral Nelson Recruiting with his Brave
Tars after the Glorious Battle of the Nile</cite>, was
published in 1798; a series of <cite>London Views</cite>, of
considerable merit and importance, entrances to the great metropolis from the
four leading turnpikes; and a series of twelve plates portraying the <cite><a href="#COMFORTS1">Comforts
of Bath</a></cite>, are most worthy of attention in the same year, as were some large
studies of reviews of the Volunteer Forces, held under the threat of the anticipated
French invasion.</p>

<p><cite><a href="#DISTRESS">Distress</a></cite>, from a large picture, indicating the horrors of shipwreck with tragic
impressiveness, is assigned to 1799.</p>

<p><cite>Summer Amusement, a Game at Bowls</cite>; <cite>Doctor Botherum, the Mountebank</cite>;
<cite>Preparations for the Academy</cite>; <cite>and A French Ordinary</cite>, were among the noticeable
features of the artist's publications in 1800; the peculiarly interesting panorama
of the Parisian world anterior to the French Revolution, entitled <cite>The Thuilleries
in Paris</cite> was also produced this year.</p>

<p>Rowlandson's skill as an etcher had further, about this time, provided him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_26" id="Page_i_26">[26]</a></span>
with abundance of work in executing the humorous conceptions of Woodward
and Bunbury after his own characteristic fashion.</p>

<p>Rowlandson's plate of <cite>The Brilliants</cite>, and a long series of subjects designed
by Woodward, with many originals of his own, sufficiently excellent in their order,
but not of the first consequence, found their way to the public in 1801. The
leading print-publishers at the West End, Rudolph Ackermann, S. W. Fores,
Williamson, and Rowlandson himself,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> at his residence, 1 James Street, Adelphi,
issued an inexhaustible collection of highly ludicrous social satires, and numerous
patriotic and political subjects, during intervening years; and in 1807 the name
of Thomas Tegg of Cheapside was added to the print-publishers who employed
the remunerative talents of the indefatigable caricaturist. Rowlandson also continued
to execute the whimsical conceptions of less qualified draughtsmen, and
swarms of comicalities&mdash;by Woodward, Bunbury, Wigstead, Nixon, and other
fashionable amateurs, who possessed the humorous vein, but lacked the skill to
give their ideas a fitting form for presentation to the public&mdash;were put into acceptable
shape, and etched by our artist at this period.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 149px;">
<img src="images/i_045.png" width="149" height="235" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In 1808 appeared the long succession of <cite>Miseries of
Human Life</cite>, of which examples occur in previous years;
and Rowlandson settled down, somewhat grimly, under
worthy Mr. Ackermann's auspices, to take up the gauntlet
against the dreaded Buonaparte, the great little Corsican,
against whom Gillray had waged such savage warfare until
his powers dwindled into vacancy, and George Cruikshank
stepped valiantly into the place of the colossus of caricaturists,
and carried on the combat with unflagging zeal and
whimsicality on his own account. Rowlandson's ludicrous attacks upon the
ambitious 'disturber of the peace of Europe' were duly appreciated by his
audience, and the demand for these blood-and-thunder caricatures increased
monthly, to the extreme delectation of the great British public, whose antipathies
to the conquering general were, at least, founded on sound and excusable principles,
and if the overflowing excess of their detestation sometimes blinded
the people to points of detail, and wilful misrepresentations passed current, and
rather swamped their more generous sentiments&mdash;which were put out of sight
for awhile&mdash;it must be remembered that this patriotic zeal was well directed
against the man who had announced his august intention of subjugating
England, and was, by accord, considered as the common enemy, and anyone
who had indulged the temerity of openly acknowledging the grander elements
of his character, since pretty tolerably established, would have been flouted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_27" id="Page_i_27">[27]</a></span>
acclamation, and we are not sure but the national scorn would have fittingly
signalised such an unpatriotic enormity.</p>

<p>It is certain that the caricaturist's travesties of the little emperor, his burlesques
of his great actions, and grandiose declarations (which, in themselves,
occasionally overdid the heroic, and trenched hazardously on the ludicrous), his
figurative displays of the mean origin of the imperial family, with the cowardice
and depravity of its members, won the popular applause; as did the satirist's representations
of the hollowness of Boney's vaunted victories, and the treachery of
his designs in the days of his success; and, when disasters began to cloud the
career of the mighty Napoleon, and cherished projects were met with sickening
failures&mdash;as army after army, collected for the slaughter by schemes, lies, fraud,
and force, melted away, and the prostrate powers of the Continent plucked up
courage, singly at first and finally in legions, until the end of the Corsican's glory
arrived&mdash;the artist lent his skill to celebrate the
delight of the public, and the rejoicings over
the discomfiture of the traditional bugbear; glib
cartoons were hurried off by Ackermann and often
by Tegg&mdash;the City competing with the West
End in the loyal contest of proving the national
enmity to Buonaparte, by buying every caricature&mdash;the
more extravagant the better relished&mdash;that
the artists, who toiled like Trojans while
the harvest lasted, could contrive to furnish in
season for the demand.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 238px;">
<img src="images/i_046.png" width="238" height="286" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A suspicion crosses our mind that, in too
many cases, the incentive was to gratify the
hatred of the Corsican, rather than any remarkable inherent merit that could
be discovered in the satires; the best of which were but feeble vehicles for
the exhibition of the jovial abilities of the designers; who, we dare venture
to hint, found themselves a little out of their element, plunged, as it were,
in the 'blood and iron' theory, striking out with their etching points with
the most approved pantomimic vengeance! Very few of these mock-heroic
sallies imprint themselves on the recollection by the sheer force of their own
brilliancy, as was the case in the single instance of James Gillray, in the past,
and as happened&mdash;an undeniable test of the veritable fire of genius&mdash;frequently
with the cartoons of John Tenniel within our own experience, when the magnitude
of the occasion has conjured up the inspiration, and rekindled the latent
flame.</p>

<p>Our reflections upon the bellicose creations of Rowlandson and Cruikshank,
while their hostile vapourings continue irresistibly droll, never stir the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_28" id="Page_i_28">[28]</a></span>
passionate emotions or reach impulses which lie below the surface; being risible,
it is true, but the reverse of inspired; and although many a hearty laugh may be
enjoyed over the ludicrous turn the twain caricaturists have, in spite of themselves,
given to situations of an avowedly tragic tendency, their very fury seems
an unctuous jest, their simulated earnestness takes a farcical turn, and the result
of a careful review, as the writer has made quite recently, of their prolific
slaughterous sallies, is the conviction that, often unconsciously to themselves,
they have chiefly succeeded, from the inevitable bent of their innate humoristic
impulses, in burlesquing the fiery feeling abroad, which the public were contented
to gratify in pictorial guise.</p>

<p>It is certain that those discriminating critics best qualified to appreciate the
talents of Rowlandson and Cruikshank, who worked up the anti-Corsican crusade
contemporaneously, are continually disposed to regret that the wondrous inventive
abilities of these fertile designers were not exercised in a more congenial
field.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 164px;">
<img src="images/i_047.png" width="164" height="212" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Our caricaturist worked away, fierce and implacable, following every turn of
Boney's fortunes with a show of savage ardour, until the idol
fell in 1815. Rowlandson, in addition to the immense mass
of caricatures which he fabricated with unflagging energy,
came out brilliantly with several large transparencies, painted
for public exhibition, outside Ackermann's Repository, on
the occasion of the general illuminations, which fittingly
signalised the successes of the allied armies after Leipsig,
the final downfall of the Emperor after Waterloo, and the
subsequent peace rejoicings.</p>

<p>A fresh subject for the exercise of Rowlandson's caricature capabilities was
furnished in 1809 by the scandalous revelations which were disclosed, as evidence
at the bar of the House of Commons, during the 'inquiry into the corrupt practices
of the Commander-in-Chief, in the administration of the army.' With
ill-advised weakness the popular Duke of York seems to have transferred the
exercise of the patronage legitimately invested in his department, to Mrs. M. A.
Clarke, a clever and unscrupulous mistress, whose extravagances he had for
awhile contributed to support at Gloucester Place. The demand for this exciting
pabulum was sufficiently eager to induce the caricaturist to bring out a
fresh pictorial satire almost daily, and sometimes two or more appeared on the
same day, while the 'delicate investigation' was proceeding, and the public
interest in the circumstances remained at a boiling heat. We are not inclined to
argue that any of these ephemeral compositions, superior as they were to the
ruck of contemporaneous productions, were worthy, in any degree, of the artist's
graphic powers, or were likely to contribute to his celebrity. For some time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_29" id="Page_i_29">[29]</a></span>
Rowlandson's ambition seemed to cool down, and although he was working hard,
and producing a fair average of results, he appeared satisfied to turn his skill to
the most prosaic account, as the means of earning a livelihood. He made no
fresh efforts to astonish his admirers, or to sustain his fame by novel efforts of
genius, such as we have particularised as appearing before the commencement of
the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Among the countless caricatures, good, bad, and indifferent, according to the
circumstances of their publication, produced between 1809 and the close of the
designer's career, nearly twenty years later, we cannot direct the reader's attention
to many subjects above the generality of similar productions by Rowlandson's
hand. It must be borne in mind that the artist's opportunities for graceful delineation
had been considerably curtailed; the fair leaders of the old picturesque
generation, whose effigies beam so charmingly on Reynolds's canvases, and the
days of powder, flowing locks, silk coats, laces, lappels, and their accompaniments,
had gradually disappeared, and left a prosier people, of sober exterior, in their
stead. The difference between the exteriors of Rowlandson's lively personages,
at the earlier part of the career, is so distinct from the outward
appearance of his surroundings, and of the world which
continued to exercise his pencil, at the close of his years,
that it is extremely difficult, with the evidence before our
eyes, to credit that such extreme changes could take place
within the lifetime of one individual. The wanton cruelty
of time in dealing thus harshly with the delicious models,
which at one period seemed expressly constituted for the exercise of Rowlandson's
pencil, may have discouraged the artist, and given him a distaste
for exertions of ambition in which his heart had no part, while his fancy still
hovered round his retrospects of the brilliant scenes, at home and abroad, that
had met his sight in his gallant youth.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 155px;">
<img src="images/i_048.png" width="155" height="173" alt="" />
</div>

<p>A few of Rowlandson's plates in 1811 recall his best days, but we are not too
confident that the originals veritably belong to the year which is engraved upon
the plates; indeed, in two cases at least, <cite>Exhibition Stare Case, Somerset House</cite>,
and <cite>Royal Academy, Somerset House</cite>, the caricatures are most probably reprints,
with the dates altered. This practice, common enough in his day, is productive
of no slight confusion; all Rowlandson's most popular conceptions, 'the palpable
hits' which held their own in the public favour, and were eagerly secured, were
republished from year to year, to meet the demand, and, in most cases, the plate
was freshly dated, as if the print had only then appeared for the first time. This
principle has complicated our task, as it is most difficult to secure even a solitary
impression of the finer works, and but scant means exist of tracing them back to
the actual date, in the absence of any considerable collections to which the student<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_30" id="Page_i_30">[30]</a></span>
may apply for purposes of reference and comparison. If the reader will be at
the pains to consult the <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/45981/45981-h/45981-h.htm#Page_ii_410">'Appendix,'</a> containing the nearest approach to an
arrangement of Rowlandson's works, under the years of publication, the writer
could arrive at under existing circumstances, it will be seen that the same caricatures
frequently reappear, with altered dates, for successive years.</p>

<p>In the latter part of the artist's career, although he executed a great many
works of interest in themselves, and his inexhaustible social satires are often
meritorious, and always ingenious, his best talents were devoted to the production
of original drawings for immediate sale. They were chiefly disposed of through
the assistance of Rudolph Ackermann, 101 Strand; and S. W. Fores, Piccadilly.
Both these steady patrons of the declining years of a genius, who must, in a
sense, have found the close of his life exposed to somewhat chilling influences,
are reported, on good authority, to have held hundreds of Rowlandson's original
drawings, scrap-books, and portfolios, filled with his admirable sketches at
the time of his death; but these collections have of course been since dispersed.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 105px;">
<img src="images/i_049.png" width="105" height="179" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In addition to the immense gathering of water-colour drawings left by Rowlandson,
which had accumulated in the possession of those respected
gentlemen with whom he held business relations, there
were several fine collections, formed about the same period, to
be found in the possession of his intimates. Mitchell the banker,
his constant friend in town, with whom Rowlandson frequently
travelled on the Continent, had secured the most remarkable
gallery of the artist's diversified views abroad, and particularly his
sketches of life and character in France and the Netherlands, the
latter being the most remarkable for broad humour. Henry Angelo, the fencing-master,
and Bannister, the comedian, ancient school-fellows of the caricaturist,
and, as will be seen, faithful comrades through life, were also steady collectors
of his picturesque eccentricities, and many noblemen, and celebrities of the day&mdash;among
them is mentioned the name of the dashing, and somewhat irrepressible,
Lord Barrymore&mdash;took a pride in filling their folios with his works, which, as
we are told, they justly esteemed 'an inexhaustible fund of amusement.'</p>

<p>A few later collections, with the names of the owners, and the titles of the
leading subjects, are mentioned at the end of this volume, with a view to completing
the interest of the subject, and affording a slight indication of the whereabouts
of many of his productions.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_31" id="Page_i_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 75px;"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="* * * * *" /></div>


<p>It appears from the statements of Rudolph Ackermann, Rowlandson's industry
was such that the considerate owner of the fashionable Repository&mdash;favourite
lounge of the dilettanti as it was&mdash;at last found it difficult, as regards
the selling department, to keep pace with his friend's creative abilities. In short,
the artist produced drawings faster than the public, as it seems evident, felt inclined
to purchase them for the time being, and it became a perplexing problem
how to increase the demand proportionately to the supply; for the multiplication
of the sketches for awhile&mdash;probably under the spur of some emergency, or the
pressure of apprehensions for the future&mdash;became so overwhelming that the
worthy publisher, in his relation as a practical man of business, fancied he foresaw
the approaching depreciation of the value of Rowlandson's drawings making such
strides, on the strength of an overstocked market, he was afraid, in the end, the
artist's remuneration would be so seriously diminished, that it would not be worth
his while to persevere, unless a new line could be successfully struck out.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 239px;">
<img src="images/i_050.png" width="239" height="198" alt="" />
</div>

<p>These anticipations were probably well founded, and we cannot but acknowledge
that our artist had discarded prudence, and
become thoroughly reckless&mdash;at least, as far as
we can judge by appearances, for possibly he
had more confidence in the ultimate request for
his studies than was entertained by his friendly
employers, and time has proved the soundness
of his judgment. If the story we are told of his
novel method of multiplying his drawings is
serious, it will strike the reader that Mr. Ackermann
had reason to feel anxious, on his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prot&eacute;g&eacute;'s</i> account. It is related that
Rowlandson would saunter from his neighbouring lodgings in the Adelphi,
round to the <cite>Repository of Arts</cite>, and, as the title of Mr. Ackermann's establishment
was no misnomer, every possible appliance was therein found ready to
hand. The artist would then order a saucer of vermillion, and another of Indian
ink, ready ground, from the colourist's room, with reed pens, and several sheets
of drawing-paper; he would then combine his inks in the proportions he thought
proper, in the flesh lines vermillion predominated, in draperies Indian ink,
shadows were a warm mixture of the two, and distant objects were faintly
rendered in Indian ink alone. The outline was filled in on this principle, but,
as the designer's own manual and dexterous rapidity had ceased to satisfy
him, he had ingeniously discovered an expeditious method of multiplication
sufficient for his purpose, without resorting to the sister art of engraving. The
drawing was made on the principle essential in any engraving which has to
give impressions, that is, the subject was reversed, right being changed to
left&mdash;the only extra care required; the outline was somewhat stronger, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_32" id="Page_i_32">[32]</a></span>
reed-pen more fully charged than was the usual practice, and when the design
was completed it formed the <em>matrix</em> from which, before the ink became fixed,
by means of a press, and paper damped to the proper consistency, it was easy
to print off duplicates as long as the ink held out. We are rather inclined
to speculate that, ingenious as the process seems, in description, it would by no
means turn out a perennial flowing fountain, and two or three decent replicas
would exhaust the original, however judiciously manipulated. The copies obtained
by this manifold contrivance were corrected and strengthened, according
to their requirements; the series of impressions were then shaded with Indian
ink, so as to lend the figures contour and solidity, and express the lighter distance;
and then came the final tinting, in delicate washes of colour, and the completed
works were ready for introduction to the public. The writer does not believe
that this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</i> was ever followed up systematically; that it has been
resorted to on occasions, his own observations have
demonstrated; and he confesses to a passing acquaintance
with a collection of drawings by the artist (belonging
to a gentleman of distinction, who is quite
satisfied as to their merits), which are for the most
part the results of this system, and he has more than
once, in the course of his peregrinations, come across
the <em>matrix</em> design, very spread and mysterious as to
outline, having been exhausted in the working, but
shaded with spirit, coloured, and sent into the world,
a shameless left-handed production, craftily smuggled
into circulation to confuse collectors, and throw discredit
on its dexter counterparts. This accounts for
a certain proportion of the duplicates after Rowlandson, which are of frequent
occurrence; and often have purchasers felt their self-esteem lowered, when
another possessor of the same design in a firmer outline has assured them that
they have been deceived into buying a mere copy, oblivious that the guilty pair
are both due to the hand of the master, and that possibly other members of the
same illicit family are lurking in the folios of rival amateurs. A grand central
gathering of works by Rowlandson, presuming a person of sufficient enterprise
could be found to prosecute the scheme of a comprehensive exhibition of the
artist's works, would reveal some curiosities in the way of reproductive capability.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 176px;">

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_052.png" width="400" height="388" alt="" />
</div>

<p>For the credit of our artist, and the comfort of collectors, we can record our
assurance that this crafty method was never persevered in, the replicas issued
under this illegitimate contrivance are confined to a brief period, the temptation
to flood the market was kept within restricted limits, and Mr. Ackermann's business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_33" id="Page_i_33">[33]</a></span>
aptitude quickly discovered a method of enhancing the caricaturist's reputation
and augmenting his means, without the necessity of resorting to tricks of ill-advised
ingenuity. The successful projection of a series of monthly publications
allowed the indefatigable projector&mdash;who exercised a princely liberality in his
dealings, as publishers go&mdash;to pay his friend, the artist, so handsomely, that he
was relieved from the necessity of multiplying his sketches in any inordinate
profusion, and enabled him to take more time and pains, both in seeking his
subjects, and working them out at his ease. The results of this happy conception,
<cite>The Poetical Magazine</cite>, the three <cite>Tours of Doctor Syntax</cite>, and <cite>The
Dance of Death</cite>, enjoyed unqualified popularity. They were followed by other
works of a corresponding description, which were also well received. The
publisher had his reward;
we have every reason to
believe that Rowlandson
enjoyed his fair share of
these successful ventures;
and continued to furnish
book-illustrations, steadily
following up the new
branch he had discovered
for the exercise of his abilities.
Mr. Ackermann's
enterprise provided him
ample occupation. These
octavo prints were produced
on the same principle
as the superior plates
after his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chefs-d'&oelig;uvre</i> of
the Academy period: a
neat and carefully finished drawing of the original design was first prepared
(these studies were afterwards purchased by Mr. Ackermann), and Rowlandson
etched the outline sharply and clearly on the copper plate, an impression from
the 'bitten-in' outline was printed on drawing-paper, and the artist put in his
shadows, modelling of forms and sketchy distance, with Indian ink, in the most
delicate handling possible; the shadows were then copied in aquatint on the
outlined plate, sometimes by the designer, but in most cases by an engraver who
practised this particular branch, which a few experts were able to manipulate
with considerable dexterity and nicety. Rowlandson next completed the colouring
of his own Indian ink shaded impression in delicate tints, harmoniously
selected; his sense of colour being of a refined order as regarded the disposal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_34" id="Page_i_34">[34]</a></span>
tender shades agreeable to the eye. His aptitude in this respect is quite as remarkable
as his ease of delineation; and, if his outlines can be copied with any approach
to deceiving the eye of a connoisseur, an attempt to imitate his colouring, simple
as it remained in its characteristics, is tolerably certain to betray the fraud.</p>

<p>The tinted impression, which was intentionally finished with greater delicacy
and elaboration than the artist generally displayed, served as a copy for imitation,
which was handed to Mr. Ackermann's trained staff of colourists, the publisher
finding constant employment for a number of clever persons whom he had educated
expressly for this skilled employment. These artists had worked under his
auspices and personal supervision for years, until, by constant practice, and the
pains which were taken by the publisher to improve their abilities, they attained
a degree of perfection and neatness never arrived at before, and almost beyond
belief in the present day, when the system has fallen into comparative disuse.
The assistants did their best to reproduce the effect of the original drawings, and
the number of impressions required to satisfy the public must have kept them
constantly at work, and occasionally jeopardised
their high finish.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 229px;">
<img src="images/i_053.png" width="229" height="218" alt="" />
</div>

<p>There is an amazing contrast between the
plates issued from the Repository, worked out like
elaborate water-colour drawings, in subdued, well-balanced
tints, with the utmost lightness and skill
of touch, and the lurid chromatic daubs which
pass current to the present day, as Rowlandson's
caricatures were issued from Cheapside '<em>price one
shilling coloured</em>,' after a school of vulgarity to
which the panorama of the Lord Mayor's Show <em>at one penny</em>, with its four
yards of florid tenuity, is quite a refined work of art.</p>

<p>We are not inclined to offer uncharitable reflections on Rowlandson's City
publisher; the caricatures&mdash;excepting always certain rougher specimens, loosely
executed enormities after designs by some of the amateurs of the period, which
indubitably belong to the slip-shod order&mdash;are fair enough in their way, when
one is lucky enough to meet with uncoloured copies; it is the bad taste of his
customers, the respectable dealer evidently stooped to flatter, with which we are
inclined to disagree, and we think justifiably; for although it was very good of
the gentleman in question to issue so many copies of his plates, with a providential
eye to the future, that impressions are sufficiently numerous to this day, all print-buyers
must deplore the waste of staring colour expended in making his publications
abominable to the sight of modern purchasers, and ruinous to the fair fame
of the designer, by the uncompromising use of three positive pigments, red, blue,
and yellow, to which, with an occasional brown, the colour-box seemed restricted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_35" id="Page_i_35">[35]</a></span>
in most cases liberally plastered over the etchings-figures, sky, buildings and
background being treated to the same smart hues in undiluted garishness, which
utterly confuses the mind as to the meritorious qualities of the subjects so
bespattered, and has the sinister effect, deplorable in itself, of compelling persons
of chaste dispositions to dread caricatures as being on the surface something
worse than scarlet abominations, fiendishly aggravated with additional lurid
iniquities of a depraving tendency.</p>

<p>We have introduced Rowlandson in his later relation to the arts, as a skilful
and popular contributor of book illustrations; we cannot leave this portion of our
subject without offering a cursory review of his various labours in this capacity,
since the wider circulation of printed publications has made his name more
familiar to the great world than the finest masterpieces already alluded to, which
seem doomed to remain unknown and inaccessible to the bulk of the public.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 235px;">
<img src="images/i_054.png" width="235" height="255" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The first independent publication we have
to notice was simply a gathering of subjects,
extending over three or four years, collected
in 1788, and issued as <cite>Rowlandson's Imitations
of Modern Drawings</cite>, folio; including
imitations of the styles of Gainsborough,
Wheatley, Mortimer, Barrett, Gilpin, Bartolozzi,
Zucchi, Cipriani, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In 1786, Rowlandson supplied G. Kearsley,
the publisher of those well-known satirical
effusions of Dr. Wolcot, <cite>The Poems of Peter
Pindar</cite>, with illustrations to the first volume
of the quarto edition of these familiar works.
This publication was continued the next year. In a burlesque strain, Rowlandson
also came out with twenty illustrations, the drawings suggested by Collings,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
caricaturing passages in Boswell's <cite>Journal of a Tour in the Hebrides</cite>, published
by E. Jackson, small folio (1786). Our artist further supplied certain plates
in parody of incidents in the <cite>Sorrows of Werther</cite>, also from suggestions by
Collings, who designed a capital series of drolleries in travesty of passages
literally extracted from Lord Chesterfield's <cite>Polite Letters</cite>.</p>

<p>G. and J. Robinson, in 1790, published the results of a trip to Brighton,
which the artist had enjoyed in company with his friend, the frequent companion
of his wanderings and frolics, Henry Wigstead, Esq., the sitting magistrate at
Bow Street&mdash;<cite>An Excursion to Brighthelmstone made in the year 1782</cite>, by Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_36" id="Page_i_36">[36]</a></span>
Wigstead and Thomas Rowlandson, with eight engravings by Thomas Rowlandson,
oblong folio.</p>

<p>There also appeared, in this and the following years, a series of <cite>Miniature
Groups and Scenes</cite>, published by M. L., Brighthelmstone, and H. Brookes,
Coventry Street, London; and a series of <cite>Sheets of Picturesque Etchings</cite>,
published by S. W. Fores. Rowlandson also furnished numerous book-plates,
octavo, to the series of novels published by I. Siebbald, Edinburgh; among the
works thus illustrated we must particularise the novels of Fielding and Smollett.</p>

<p>The succeeding year (1792) our artist also contributed illustrations, in large
size folding plates, designed after suggestions by Henry Woodward, to a quarto
edition of Smollett's Novels. <cite>Cupid's Magic Lantern</cite>, with illustrations, etched
by Rowlandson, also after designs by Henry Woodward, was published in 1797.</p>

<p><cite><a href="#COMFORTS1">The Comforts of Bath</a></cite>, and the folio <cite>Views of London</cite>, belong to 1798. The
same year the name of W. Wigstead, Charing Cross, appears as the publisher of
the following <span class="locked">works:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><cite>Annals of Horsemanship</cite>, with seventeen
copperplates by Henry Bunbury,
Esq. Engraved by Thomas Rowlandson.</p>

<p><cite>The Academy for Grown Horsemen</cite>,
with twelve copperplates, by Henry
Bunbury, Esq. Engraved by Thomas
Rowlandson.</p>

<p><cite>Love in Caricature</cite>, with eleven plates
by Thomas Rowlandson.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 263px;">
<img src="images/i_055.png" width="263" height="218" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The handsome and expensively got-up publications inaugurated by Mr.
Ackermann, began to occupy our artist in 1799. The first of this well-executed
series, with which Rowlandson was connected, was a set of plates, accurately
coloured in <em>fac-simile</em> of the original drawings, in square folio, described as,</p>

<p><cite>The Loyal Volunteers of London and Environs</cite>, with eighty-seven plates,
designed and etched by Thomas Rowlandson.</p>

<p>Martial ardour being the key-note this year, when foreign invasion menaced
our shores, Henry Angelo and Son, who were appointed fencing-masters to the
Light Horse Volunteers of London and Westminster, collected a series of subjects
which the artist had prepared under their direction, and issued the results
of their joint ingenuity as a supplement to the elder Angelo's <cite>Treatise on Fencing</cite>,
under the title of, <cite>Hungarian and Highland Broadsword Exercise</cite>, with twenty-four
plates designed and etched by Thomas Rowlandson, oblong folio.</p>

<p>Another publication, issued by Ackermann in 1799, appeared as <cite>Delineations
of Nautical Characters</cite>, in ten plates by Thomas Rowlandson.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_37" id="Page_i_37">[37]</a></span></p>


<p>In 1800, the results of an excursion to North and South Wales, undertaken
in concert by the author and artist, were given to the public under the following
description: <cite>Remarks on a Tour to North and South Wales in the year 1797</cite>, by
Henry Wigstead, with plates by Thomas Rowlandson, Pugh, Howitt, &amp;c.
Published by W. Wigstead, Charing Cross.</p>

<p>Rowlandson also supplied some illustrations to <cite>The Beauties of Sterne</cite>, a selection
of choice passages from the works of that author.</p>

<p>A series of <cite>Views in Cornwall, Dorset, &amp;c.</cite>, appeared as a separate publication
in 1805. The artist contributed serious book-plates to an edition of the
<cite>Sorrows of Werther</cite>, in 1806. A smaller edition of the witty <cite>Annals of Horsemanship</cite>
and <cite>Academy for Grown Horsemen</cite> (portions of which are attributed
to the pen of the convivial Captain Grose, the well-known antiquary, author of
<cite>The Military Antiquities</cite>, etc.&mdash;the original design of the work with the illustrations
belonged to Henry Bunbury) was issued in a cheap form by Thomas Tegg
in 1800, the etchings being executed in a reduced form by Thomas Rowlandson,
and published under the title of <cite>An Academy for Grown Horsemen and Annals
of Horsemanship, by Geoffry Gambado</cite>, octavo. A collection of
plates portraying <cite>The Miseries of Human Life</cite>, consisting of fifty
etchings by Thomas Rowlandson, small folio, was published in a
reduced form the same year.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 118px;">
<img src="images/i_056.png" width="118" height="178" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The principal work, however, which appeared in 1808, was,
and must remain, a fitting instance of the enterprise and good
taste of Rudolph Ackermann, his liberal employment of artists
whose abilities were of the first order; while demonstrating the
popularity of his publications, which could guarantee the most considerable
outlays, with a successful return of the capital invested.</p>

<p>We refer to the splendid <cite>Microcosm of London, or London in Miniature</cite>, with
105 illustrations by Pugin and Rowlandson, in three volumes, quarto. A more
extended notice of this valuable series is given in its proper place in this volume,
under the description of works for 1808; although we believe the actual preparation
of the plates extended over some years.</p>

<p>We have also to notice:&mdash;</p>

<p><cite>The Caricature Magazine, or Hudibrastic Mirror</cite>, published by Thomas
Tegg, and continued to 1810, 386 plates, in five volumes, oblong folio.</p>

<p><cite>The Art of Ingeniously Tormenting</cite>, with illustrations by Rowlandson and
Woodward, octavo; published by Thomas Tegg, Cheapside, 1808.</p>

<p><cite>A Lecture on Heads</cite>, by George Alexander Stevens, with twenty-five illustrations
by Rowlandson and Woodward, octavo, published by Thomas Tegg,
Cheapside, 1808.</p>

<p><cite>Chesterfield Travestie; or School for Modern Manners</cite>, with ten caricatures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_38" id="Page_i_38">[38]</a></span>
engraved by Rowlandson from drawings by H. Woodward (who supplied the
letterpress), duodecimo, was also published by Thomas Tegg, Cheapside. 1808.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 159px;">
<img src="images/i_057.png" width="159" height="273" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In 1809, appeared numerous book-plates supplied by the artist to publishers.
Thomas Tegg issued an edition of <cite>Sterne's Sentimental Journey</cite>, and <cite>The
Beauties of Sterne</cite>, in a separate volume; both <em>embellished with caricatures by
T. Rowlandson</em>. This gentleman also published an edition of <cite>The Surprising
Adventures of the renowned Baron Munchausen</cite>, with numerous original engravings
by Thomas Rowlandson; <cite>The Annals of Sporting by Caleb Quizem</cite>, with
illustrations by Rowlandson and Woodward; <cite>Advice to Sportsmen, selected from
the Notes of Marmaduke Markwell</cite>; with sixteen illustrations by Rowlandson;
<cite>The Trial of the Duke of York</cite>, with Rowlandson's collected caricatures on the
subject, in two volumes; <cite>Investigation of the Charges brought against H.R.H.
the Duke of York, &amp;c.</cite>, with fourteen portraits by Rowlandson, two volumes;
and Butler's <cite>Hudibras</cite>, with five illustrations by William
Hogarth, engraved by Thomas Rowlandson.</p>

<p>Beresford's <cite>Antidote to the Miseries of Human Life</cite>,
octavo, is also advertised in 1809.</p>

<p><cite>The Pleasures of Human Life</cite>, by Hilari Benevolus
&amp; Co., with five plates by Thomas Rowlandson, &amp;c.,
was published by Longmans, 1809.</p>

<p>It was in 1809 that Ackermann projected his <cite>Poetical
Magazine</cite>, royal octavo, which, it was arranged, should
appear in consecutive monthly parts, as a means of
affording his friend, the artist, substantial and progressive
employment. The generous thought which prompted
this enterprise was fittingly rewarded by the successful
reception this venture secured at the hands of the public,
and the patrons of Ackermann's 'Repository of Arts.' <cite>The Poetical Magazine</cite>
was quite a feature amongst novel publications; the famous plates supplied by
Rowlandson (two monthly), and the verses felicitously written up to the caricaturist's
designs by William Coombe, under the title of <cite>The Schoolmasters' Tour</cite>,
and introducing the highly popular <cite>Doctor Syntax</cite>, formed the only important
contributions to the Magazine, which came to a conclusion (at the fourth volume),
with the end of the first <cite>Picturesque Tour</cite>.</p>

<p>The success which attended the appearance of the familiar <em>Tour</em> was
altogether beyond the expectations of either publisher, artist, or author. The
etchings on the plates to <cite>The Poetical Magazine</cite> were worked fairly away and
renewed. In 1812, <cite>The Tour of Doctor Syntax in Search of the Picturesque</cite>,
with thirty-one illustrations by Thomas Rowlandson, was published in a separate
form in royal octavo, a fresh set of the much-admired plates, with but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_39" id="Page_i_39">[39]</a></span>
slightest variations, being prepared expressly, and these in turn proved insufficient
to supply the number of copies demanded by the delighted public. The
<em>Tour</em> had a still larger success in its independent form, and several editions
appeared in one season; the request continued for years, and was sufficiently
encouraging to induce the projectors to follow it up with a new series, <cite>The
Second Tour of Doctor Syntax, in Search of Consolation</cite>, with twenty-four illustrations
by Thomas Rowlandson, which also appeared in monthly parts, and was
issued in a collected form in one volume, royal octavo, in 1820. A third tour,
in <cite>Search of a Wife</cite>, was ventured in 1822, but this was evidently intended to
be the final sequel, as the hero, 'Doctor Syntax,' is removed from life's scene at
the close.</p>

<p>Returning to Rowlandson's successive contributions of book-illustrations,
we find a satirical work, <cite>Munchausen at Walcheren</cite> issued in 1811; and a <cite>Tale
of the Castle</cite> (Dublin), published by Stockdale in 1812, as <cite>Petticoat Loose, a
Fragmentary Poem</cite>, illustrated with four plates by Thomas Rowlandson, quarto.</p>

<p>The artist also issued a series of
<cite>Views of Cornwall</cite> in the form of an
independent volume the same year.</p>

<p>Mr. Ackermann had introduced,
some years before, an illustrated
Miscellany to his subscribers, which
ran a long and highly successful
career, under the title, borrowed from
the circumstances of its publication,
of <cite>Ackermann's Repository of Arts, Literature, Fashion, and Manufactures</cite>.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 279px;">
<img src="images/i_058.png" width="279" height="176" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In the pages of this admirable magazine were given many continuous contributions
of a valuable and interesting character, the contents being as diversified
as the description of the undertaking. Among the serials were numerous essays
of merit, which, in the projector's opinion, were entitled to the distinction
of separate publication, and, at intervals, the discriminating proprietor of the
<cite>Repository</cite> selected various series of articles by his best qualified and most
respected colleagues in the work, and re-issued their contributions, with the
enhanced attraction of fresh pictorial embellishments, as separate publications.
In this manner a succession of <cite>Letters from Italy</cite>, which had appeared in the
<cite>Repository</cite>, between 1809 and 1813, furnished by Lewis Engelbach (who supplied
reviews of music; it has been said his criticisms may be usefully studied
by the most successful living contributors to the press), were republished in 1815
in one volume, royal octavo, as <cite>Letters from Naples and the Campana Felice</cite>,
with seventeen illustrations by Thomas Rowlandson.</p>

<p>Another deserving work, published by R. Ackermann, in the same finished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_40" id="Page_i_40">[40]</a></span>
style, with coloured engravings in aquatint, delicately completed by hand to
resemble water-colour drawings, as were the major part of the illustrations to
this series, appeared under the title of <cite>Poetical Sketches of Scarborough</cite>, with
twenty-one illustrations by J. Green; etched by Thomas Rowlandson, 1813.</p>

<p>In 1815 was published The <cite>Military Adventures of Johnny Newcome</cite>, with
fifteen illustrations by Thomas Rowlandson, royal octavo, printed for Patrick
Martin, 198 Oxford Street. This work is written in Hudibrastic metre, by 'An
Officer' in imitation of the flowing lines supplied by Coombe to the <cite>Tours of
Doctor Syntax</cite>. Another volume (1815 and 1816) was published by Thomas
Tegg, Cheapside, also composed after the model of the same easy versification,
under the description of <cite>The Grand Master, or Adventures of Qui Hi in
Hindostan, a Hudibrastic poem in eight cantos, by Quiz</cite>, illustrated with twenty-eight
engravings by Thomas Rowlandson.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 120px;">
<img src="images/i_059.png" width="120" height="179" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The principal triumph of our artist's later years appeared in 1815 and 1816,
Rowlandson inventing the subjects, and Coombe supplying the descriptive
versification, as was their usual method of proceeding in the
entire succession of publications, undertaken under this artistic
and literary co-partnership, and issued by R. Ackermann.</p>

<p>We refer to the <cite>Dance of Death</cite>, which had first been
offered the public in monthly parts under the old and highly
successful system, between 1814 and 1816. This production,
which repays the most careful consideration, received a flattering
reception, and, in spite of the grim nature of the subject,
enjoyed surprising popularity, and added considerably to the
reputation of those concerned in its appearance. We have no hesitation in
recording our impression that the ingenuity and invention displayed in the
seventy-two plates illustrative of the <cite>Dance of Death</cite> are considerably in advance,
in point of invention, of the pictures supplied to its more genial and popular
rival <cite>Doctor Syntax</cite>. Both artist and author had arrived at a period of mature
experience, which qualified and disposed them to bring their finest faculties to the
treatment of this melodramatic theme, in which they must have discovered morbid
fascinations; since it has enabled them to rise above their average efforts. As
we have noticed, although the conception is monumental, not to say sepulchral,
in its characteristics, and on occasions, ghastly in its humour, the result is a
masterpiece to the memories of Rowlandson and Coombe; the fires of their
early inspirations were rekindled from their decline; and the <cite>Dance of Death</cite>
has always impressed us as the last flicker of expiring genius; a fitting memorial
of the vast and almost forgotten faculties of the projectors.</p>

<p>A fuller account of this impressive and truly remarkable work, will be found
under the year 1810, where we have endeavoured to do justice to the exceptional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_41" id="Page_i_41">[41]</a></span>
qualities of a performance which, in our modest conviction, surpasses any previous
treatment of the same subject.</p>

<p>In 1816 Rowlandson commenced a series of charming little pictures designed
in outline, avowedly intended as an assistance to landscape-artists in the direction
of suggesting, and supplying animated groups of figures, suitable for introduction
into drawings. The etchings were executed with exceptional neatness, ease, and
spirit, and the entire collection is highly interesting; it appeared under the title
of <cite>The World in Miniature, figure subjects for Landscapes, Groups, and Views</cite>,
and was published by Mr. Ackermann at 'The Repository.' A series of a
similar description was commenced under the same designation by Rowlandson
in 1821, and finished by W. H. Pyne in 1826; the set was somewhat diffusive,
if it extended to 637 parts, as we are told.</p>

<p>Our artist's illustrations to the <cite>Beauties of Tom Brown</cite> belong to 1809.</p>

<p>Rowlandson also contributed a frontispiece to another of Tegg's publications
in 1816, <cite>The Relics of a Saint, by Ferdinand Farquhar</cite>.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 120px;">
<img src="images/i_060.png" width="120" height="124" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Rowlandson found a congenial exercise for his skill,
taste, and mirth-imparting qualities in the illustration
of Oliver Goldsmith's <cite>Vicar of Wakefield</cite>, in 1817,
when the famous tale re-appeared, embellished with
twenty-four designs by the artist. Mr. Ackermann
was induced to republish this delightful story as a
vehicle for the display of the delicate humoristic, and
more refined qualifications of the caricaturist (who, by
the way, had almost ceased to deserve this epithet).
Nothing could be more artless than the pathos of this fiction, its simple humour
is ever fresh, and Rowlandson has executed his portion of the undertaking in
a congenial spirit, indeed the happy impulses of the author seem spontaneously
embodied in the picturesque designs.</p>

<p>The success of the <cite>Dance of Death</cite> was so considerable that the publisher
endeavoured to share its popularity with a successor. The two volumes constituting
the first work were, however, executed in a superior manner; and
more pains were taken to bring the plates to the utmost perfection, as reproductions
of the original drawings, than was the case with later publications.
<cite>The Dance of Life</cite>, illustrated with twenty-eight coloured engravings by
Thomas Rowlandson, published by R. Ackermann, royal octavo, appeared
in 1817, and although fairly executed, neither the conceptions of Rowlandson,
nor the verses of Coombe, rose above the commonplace; it is evident that
the sentiment which had inspired their gifted faculties in the former subject
found no revival in the present volume, which is somewhat disappointing after
the talent which is manifested in its predecessor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_42" id="Page_i_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>A pendant to the <cite>Military Adventures of Johnny Newcome</cite> was issued in
1818 as <cite>The Adventures of Johnny Newcome in the Navy</cite>, a poem in four cantos,
with sixteen plates by Rowlandson from the author's designs, by Alfred Burton,
published by Simpkin and Marshall, Stationers' Hall Court, Ludgate Hill. More
attention was paid to the artistic preparation of the succeeding portion of <cite>The
Second Tour of Doctor Syntax in Search of Consolation</cite>, with twenty-four illustrations
by Thomas Rowlandson, royal octavo, which Mr. Ackermann introduced
to the public in a collected form as the companion to the popular first volume
in 1820.</p>

<p>Rowlandson also furnished illustrations to certain pamphlets or chapbooks in
1819; we may particularise one under the title of <cite>Who killed Cock Robin?</cite>&mdash;a
tract on the Manchester Massacre, published by John Cahnac. We have also to
notice his contribution to a chapbook which appeared the same year, as, <cite>Female
Intrepidity, or the Heroic Maiden</cite>.</p>

<p>The same year appeared <cite>Rowlandson's Characteristic Sketches of the Lower
Orders; intended as a Companion to the New Picture of London</cite> containing
fifty-four coloured plates, printed by S. Leigh,
18 Strand, 1820.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 164px;">

</div>

<p>Another contribution, <cite>A Tour in the
South of France</cite>, drawn from the excellent
serial publication, 'Ackermann's Repository
of Arts, Literature, Fashion, and Manufactures,'
originally supplied to its pages in
instalments between the years 1817 and 1820, was republished in a completed
form in 1821, with additional attractions, in the way of fresh embellishments, by
the unflagging hand of our artist, under the title of <cite>A Journal of Sentimental
Travels in the Southern Provinces of France</cite>, illustrated with eighteen coloured
engravings from designs by Thomas Rowlandson, royal octavo, published by
R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.</p>

<p>A French version of 'Doctor Syntax's Tour in Search of the Picturesque,'
<cite>Le Don Quichotte Romantique, ou Voyage du Docteur Syntaxe à la Recherche du
Pittoresque et du Romantique</cite>, also appeared in Paris this year, with twenty-eight
illustrations, drawn on stone, after the original designs of Rowlandson, by
Malapeau, lithographed by G. Engelmann.</p>

<p>The final complement of 'The Tours,' prepared under the same auspices
as the earlier peregrinations, reached completion as an additional volume in
1822, and the monthly instalments were then reissued in a collected form to
join the two predecessors as <cite>The Third Tour of Doctor Syntax in Search of
a Wife</cite>, with twenty-five illustrations by Thomas Rowlandson, royal octavo,
published by R. Ackermann.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_43" id="Page_i_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>A further instance of the universal popularity enjoyed by <cite>The First Tour
of Doctor Syntax in Search of the Picturesque</cite> was afforded, in 1822, by the
appearance of an edition translated into German and freely adapted as <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Reise
des Doktor Syntax um das Malerische au Frusuchen</i> with Rowlandson's famous
illustrations imitated on stone and lithographed by F. E. Rademacher, Berlin.</p>

<p>The interest which it was found, on experience, still surrounded the grotesque
prototype <cite>Dr. Syntax</cite>, induced the energetic projectors&mdash;publisher, artist, and
author&mdash;under their old, well-defined relations, to venture on a farther
extension of the familiar framework, and a fresh volume, which had, like the
preceding publications, found its way to the public in monthly instalments, was
inaugurated in 1822 under the description of <cite>The History of Johnny Quæ
Genus: The Little Foundling of the late Doctor Syntax&mdash;a poem by the author of
The Three Tours</cite> (William Coombe)&mdash;embellished with twenty-four coloured
engravings by Thomas Rowlandson.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 95px;">
<img src="images/i_062.png" width="95" height="118" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The same year our artist issued another distinct volume of landscape subjects
of his execution under the title of <cite>Rowlandson's Sketches from Nature</cite>; a
collection of seventeen plates, drawn and etched by the artist
and aquatinted by Stradler. <cite>Crimes of the Clergy</cite>, an octavo
volume, with two plates by our artist, also appeared in 1822.</p>

<p>As a further proof that the numerous editions in royal
octavo of the illustrious schoolmaster's wanderings were insufficient
to satisfy the requirements of his patrons, Mr. Ackermann
offered the public a fresh copy, in three volumes 16mo.
of <cite>The Three Tours of Dr. Syntax, Pocket Edition</cite>, with all
Rowlandson's plates, executed on a smaller scale to suit the convenience of
enthusiasts, who might require to carry the volumes about with them ready
for immediate reference, or for perusal on their travels and at odd moments, if
such an opportunity should be in request.</p>

<p>In 1825 Charles Molloy Westmacott, an intimate friend of the caricaturist,
in whose company we learn he visited Paris, thought proper to edit a publication
under his pseudonym of 'Bernard Blackmantle,' a collection of whimsical extracts
from the press, which had appeared in print in the previous season. The
description of his production is as follows: <cite>The Spirit of the Public Journals
for the year 1824, with Explanatory Notes</cite>. Illustrations on wood by T. Rowlandson,
R. and G. Cruikshank, Lane, and Findlay. London; published by
Sherwood, Jones, and Co., Paternoster Row, 1825. Our artist contributed
eleven highly humorous cuts to this publication, his drawings being engraved
on wood&mdash;a novel process as far as the designs usually supplied by Rowlandson
are concerned.</p>

<p>A notable plate was furnished by the caricaturist in 1825 to <cite>The English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_44" id="Page_i_44">[44]</a></span>
Spy</cite>, a work also produced under the auspices of 'Bernard Blackmantle,' after
the description of the better-known <cite>Life in London</cite>. The major part of the
plates are due to the hand of Robert Cruikshank. Rowlandson's name is given
on the title-page as having contributed a portion of the illustrations on wood,
but the only example of his skill we have been able to identify is an adaptation
of his drawing (now the property of Mr. Capron), <cite>The Life School at the Royal
Academy</cite>, which he originally presented to his old friend John Thomas Smith,
of the British Museum. Plate 32.&mdash;<cite>R. A&mdash;ys of Genius Reflecting on the True
Line of Beauty at the Life Academy, Somerset House</cite>, by Thomas Rowlandson;
and this illustration is undeniably the most interesting to be found in the entire
contents of the two octavo volumes of which Mr. Westmacott's <cite>English Spy</cite> is
composed; further particulars of this subject are given under the year 1825.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_063.png" width="600" height="193" alt="" />
</div>

<p>After the caricaturist's death in 1827 the admirable publications, of which
his coloured plates formed the principal attractions, were discontinued; the taste
of the public had changed. Wood blocks and steel plates came into fashion.
Cheap annuals illustrated with woodcuts came into favour for a season, until
the appearance of the more elaborately prepared 'Gift Books,' with fine steel
engravings, 'Keepsakes,' 'Gems,' &amp;c., subsequently took their place. The
folios of Mr. Ackermann were still sufficiently rich in studies by Rowlandson to
furnish the framework for a fresh publication. A choice was made from the
large collection of original drawings, published and unpublished, which still
remained, after the artist's decease, in the possession of the indefatigable
proprietor of the 'Repository'; and these sketches, which of necessity, for the
most part, are assignable to Rowlandson's declining period, when his drawings
became looser in execution and less picturesque in point of subject, were
selected as the materials for a new venture, with a departure from the old popular
style of reproduction in facsimile of the artist's pictures coloured by hand.</p>

<p>The subjects culled from Mr. Ackermann's portfolios were redrawn on a
reduced scale, either as a whole, or striking portions of caricatures, and prominent
figures or groups were adapted, transferred to wood-blocks, and put into
the hands of an engraver. In cutting the designs a considerable amount of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_45" id="Page_i_45">[45]</a></span>
original spirit, with the individuality of execution peculiar to the master, have
unfortunately been sacrificed; the engravings are heavy and poor; however,
they offer a rough idea of the nature of the studies which happened to remain
in the hands of the publisher, and some interest attaches to this circumstance,
as the major part of these designs have never been issued on copper.</p>

<p>Mr. W. H. Harrison was engaged to write up to the pictorial sketches, and
he has constructed various small fictions founded on the suggestions offered by
the engravings; but the entire work is somewhat clumsy in contrivance, both as
respects the illustrations and the literary setting intended to assist their interest
in the eyes of the public; the editor's inventions are neither original nor brilliant.
The title of the annual produced on this compound principle was <cite>The Humourist,
a Companion for the Christmas Fireside, embellished with fifty engravings,
exclusive of numerous vignettes after designs by the late Thomas Rowlandson</cite>:
published by R. Ackermann, 96 Strand, and sold by R. Ackermann, junior, 191
Regent Street, 1831. <cite>The Humourist</cite> contained sixty-seven illustrations in all;
the titles of these, and a brief description of the various subjects, will be found
at the close of the present volume, under the year 1831.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 75px;"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="* * * * *" /></div>

<p>Although Rowlandson was so well known as an artist, no fitting memorials
of his career are extant; and while, as we have related, the task of discovering
a collection of works by the artist, worthy of illustrating his exceptional abilities,
is surrounded by unforeseen difficulties, the operation of culling personal traits,
or records of the life and adventures of the caricaturist, demands even greater
extensions of patience. Nothing short of sincere appreciation for the vast talents
of the man, and of a lasting conviction of the original qualities of his works,
could have encouraged the writer to prolong his researches, the chances in this
case of alighting on any discoveries of note being so problematical.</p>

<p>The person of Rowlandson was familiarly recognised amongst his contemporaries
from his youth, when he was first admitted as a student at the schools
of the Royal Academy (about 1770), through his diversified fortunes, till his
death, which occurred on April 22, 1827.</p>

<p>His figure, we learn, was large, well set-up, muscular, and above the average
height&mdash;in fact, his person was a noticeable one; his features were regular and
defined, his eye remarkably full and fearless, his glance being described as
penetrating, and suggestive of command; his mouth and chin expressed firmness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_47" id="Page_i_47">[47]</a></span>
and resolution; the general impression conveyed to a stranger by his
countenance, which was undeniably fine and striking in its characteristics, was
that of the inflexibility of the owner.</p>

<p>Two or three portraits of the caricaturist are traceable, besides numerous
burlesque transfers of his own effigy to his imaginary personages. In common
with Cruikshank, Thackeray, and many other humorists of the brush and
etching-needle, he was prone to introduce the presentment of his own lineaments
in whimsical juxtapositions. The most generally recognised likeness, from
which a separate plate has been published by Mr. Parker, occurs in a clever
eccentric drawing, exhibited by the artist at the Royal Academy Exhibition in
1787, under the title of <cite>Countrymen and Sharpers</cite> (No. 555).</p>

<p>This subject was subsequently engraved by J. K. Sherwin, whose portrait
also figures therein, in the person of the pigeon, while Rowlandson has chosen to
represent himself as the leading sharper, he who, with blustering front, is fleecing
the simple youth at cards, in defiance of his well-accepted reputation for rigid
integrity; for although the gaming table long held the caricaturist an enslaved
votary, ready to make the most reckless sacrifices to tempt the fickle favours of
the gambler's fortune, it is recorded by those of his acquaintances who have
mentioned this disastrous failing (which by the way he shared with all the
wealthy, distinguished, and witty celebrities of his day), and deplored the havoc
it made with his means, and professional pursuits, that his sense of honour was
ever of the keenest, his word was always regarded as sufficient security, and he
possessed a delicacy of feeling, and a sense of independence, which would not
allow him to remain under a debt or an obligation.</p>

<p>At the time Rowlandson sent his drawing of <cite>Countrymen and Sharpers</cite><a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> for
exhibition, he was 31 years of age, and according to the portrait, looks manhood
personified, with a fine comely figure, and a face that imprints itself on the recollection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_48" id="Page_i_48">[48]</a></span>
his hair in a profusion of wavy tresses, worn long, and 'clubbed' as was
the fashion of the period. His bold and piercing eyes set under massive and
somewhat prominent brows.</p>


<p>The next attributed portrait belongs to 1799, when Rowlandson was 43 years
of age. In the design, <cite>An Artist travelling in Wales</cite>, the result of a journey he
made with his friend, the convivial Henry Wigstead, he has represented himself,
with a due allowance for burlesque, looking older than his years; the long hair is
still there, but its curls are thinned, time and a struggle with seasons less rosy
than his youth of many fortunes, are telling on the outward man, but the brows,
eyes, mouth and chin have diminished nothing of their resolute characteristics&mdash;indeed,
they are more marked&mdash;and the strong nervous figure is beginning to look
gaunt.</p>

<p><cite>The Chamber of Genius</cite> appeared in 1812 with the appropriate <span class="locked">quotation:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">

<span class="i0">Want is the scorn of every wealthy fool;</span>
<span class="i0">And genius in rags is turned to ridicule.&mdash;Juv. <i>Sat.</i><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The head of the caricaturist is strongly defined on the shoulders of the gifted
occupant of a garret, and the likeness is just what might be supposed from the
countenance, as given in 1787, viewed through the intervening quarter of a
century of struggles, and disenchantments, when cares of the hour, and incidental
anxieties, touching provision for the future, had commenced to take the place of
the artist's original careless hardihood.</p>

<p>The last portrait to which we shall at present refer is by another hand; and
was sketched when the health of the caricaturist was a grave source of apprehension,
since we learn that during the last two years of his life he was a severe
sufferer. It represents the figure of a large and powerful-looking old gentleman,
of impressive presence; the main characteristics, and the marked profile have
gathered force with increasing years, the brows are even firmer, and the features
more defined; this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">croquis</i> of the veteran was drawn by his old friend, and
erst fellow-pupil, John Thomas Smith, the keeper of the drawings and prints in
the British Museum, and the study was taken while the caricaturist was looking
over some prints, on one of his visits to the treasures in his friend's department.
The sketcher, who has written the circumstances under which it was taken,
below the portrait, has given Rowlandson's age at seventy,&mdash;within a year, in
fact, of his death. The caricaturist's flowing locks are considerably shorn by
the hand of the inevitable mower, and his penetrating eyes do not disdain the
assistance afforded by a pair of huge tortoiseshell-rimmed spectacles, in which
they are framed; but as far as the visible flight of time goes, regarding the
outward man, he might be assumed to possess powers of vitality sufficient to
carry him over another score years.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_49" id="Page_i_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>If our memory does not deceive us, a sketch of the caricaturist's figure, from
the life, and drawn in chalks, was exhibited some time ago at Bethnal Green,
in the Loan Collection, formed under the auspices of the Science and Art
Department.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 75px;"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="* * * * *" /></div>

<p>We learn that our artist, who is perhaps the most popularly recognised practitioner
of the caricature branch, was born in the Old Jewry, in July 1756, that is
to say, just a year before his remarkable compeer James Gillray. The members
of the Rowlandson family, according to the little we can trace of their personal
history, seem to have been highly respectable people of the middle class in life.
The name is not of common occurrence. There is a tract relating certain misfortunes
which attended two bearers of this cognomen; a pious and worthy couple
who in the seventeenth century went evangelising to New England, where they
suffered incredible persecutions, and escaped all sorts of dismal tortures amongst
the aboriginal Indians, in whose hands they had the mischance to fall; the
succession of hardships which they encountered, and their final miraculous deliverance,
are duly recorded for the encouragement of the faithful. The narrative,
which is simple and circumstantial, forms an item of 'improving reading' not
without its interest in the present age. There is nothing to prove the relationship
of this faithful and much-enduring pair to our caricaturist, beyond the circumstance
of the similarity of name. Rowlandson the elder was assuredly at one
time a man of fair substance, as we are informed&mdash;'some say a city merchant,' but
his disposition, like that of his son, seems to have been tinctured with recklessness.
Mention is made of an uncle Thomas Rowlandson, who was godfather to the
subject of our notice; also, as far as we can discover, connected with mercantile
pursuits. This relationship was destined to serve the caricaturist in good stead, if
he had only exercised the commonest prudence in husbanding the resources
which he derived from this connection. We discover that, before Rowlandson
had arrived at man's estate, his chances of inheriting a provision to help him on
his way, together with the prospect of any future support, so far as the paternal
resources were concerned, had melted away; the elder Rowlandson's 'speculative
turn' had taken a sinister bent, considerable sums had been sunk, and still more
portentous liabilities had been incurred, 'by experimenting on various branches
of manufacture,' which were attempted on too extensive a scale for the means at
his command; and, his resources becoming exhausted, before the fruition of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_50" id="Page_i_50">[50]</a></span>
schemes, pecuniary embarrassments involved his career, and he failed to realise
the considerable fortune which his sanguine temperament had anticipated. The
natural talents of the son, and the professional training which had cultivated his
gifts, were the only contributions he received, on attaining manhood, towards his
future maintenance, as far as the help he could derive from his father was concerned.
Other adventitious aids came to the artist's assistance, indeed, in spite
of the untoward direction which the previous prosperity of the elder had taken,
Rowlandson was to a large degree the spoiled child of fortune throughout his
early career.</p>

<a id="HOW_TO"></a><img src="images/i_069.jpg" width="500" height="380" alt="" />
<div class="caption">HOW TO TREAT A REFRACTORY MEMBER.</div>
</div>

<p>We are not informed whether the paternal estate was restored to solvency.
Among the various 'valuable legacies' which, it is related, fell to the caricaturist's
share (only to be scattered broadcast), it is very possible that, in some sort, an
inheritance from his father formed part of these unexpected 'good gifts.' It
seems, although we have no direct records of the remaining relatives, that
Rowlandson had a sister, since we learn that his brother-in-law was Howitt,
famous as an artist for his delineation of animals, for his spirited hunting subjects,
being eminent as a sportsman, rider, and angler; and, like the caricaturist, somewhat
of a spoiled child&mdash;a wayward genius&mdash;of a congenial soul, and vivacious
impulses, a trifle too given to yield to careless convivial company, or the allurements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_51" id="Page_i_51">[51]</a></span>
which the hour might hold forth, oblivious of sober consequences to
follow.</p>

<p>Thomas Rowlandson, the uncle, had married a certain Mademoiselle Chattelier,
who was, it is evident, a lady with some command of wealth; and from
the partiality and indulgence of this aunt, our artist, we are told, 'derived that
assistance which his father's reverse of fortune had withheld.'</p>

<p>Another reference to the family name further occurs amongst the announcements
of marriages for September 1800 (<cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite>, vol. 70, p. 898),
where we find that Thomas Rowlandson, Esq., of Watling Street, espoused Miss
Stuart, daughter of George Stuart, Esq., of the Grove, Camberwell, Surrey. It
is obvious that Rowlandson senior intended to give his son a sound training.
As a school-boy, the future celebrity wandered into the precincts of that Soho
district to which he afterwards clung in his varying fortunes with the persistence
developed by habit.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 193px;">
<img src="images/i_070.png" width="193" height="135" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The caricaturist began to draw his first instalments from the fount of knowledge
at the scholastic symposium of Doctor Barvis in Soho Square, 'at that
time, and subsequently, an academy of some celebrity.' We are told this establishment
was kept by Doctor Barrow when young
Rowlandson was pursuing his studies. The respectability
of the school, and its soundness as an educational
institution, is satisfactorily demonstrated to our
mind from the circumstance that the great Edmund
Burke had elected to confide his beloved son, with
whose training, it is well known, the philosopher took especial pains, to the
charge of Doctor Barrow; and Richard Burke, the gentle gifted youth whose
untimely death hastened the decease of his patriotic father, was a school-fellow of
our artist. J. G. Holman, who was destined to acquire reputation as a dramatic
writer and performer, was another school-fellow. It appears that, within the
walls of this academy, Rowlandson made the acquaintance of John Bannister,
whose inimitable talents were afterwards to delight the town, and whose name is
a lasting ornament to the histrionic profession; it was, further, in Soho Square
that young Rowlandson and young Angelo, the son of the well-known Henry
Angelo (one of the best recognised and most respected foreigners domiciled in
London of his day), fencing-master to the Royal Family, became fast and firm
friends. The intimacy existing between this worthy trio, dating from these early
days, continued steadfastly through life. All these lads were, in different degrees,
enthusiasts of the graphic art; Angelo and Bannister had strong predilections for
the arts, and both drew as amateurs in their subsequent careers, although, with
Rowlandson, they originally meditated following up the artist's profession seriously.
As to our friend Rolley, like all beginners gifted with the pictorial vein, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_52" id="Page_i_52">[52]</a></span>
could make sketches intuitively before he had learnt to do anything else, as
seems the rule with youths who possess the artistic faculty and an imaginative
temperament; his powers of fancy directed his hand at a precociously juvenile
age to the practice of exercising his abilities with pencil and pen. 'From the
early period of his childhood,' it is recorded, 'Rowlandson gave presage of his
future talent;' he could make sketches before he learned to write, and, according
to the usual course, 'he drew humorous characters of his master and many of
his scholars, before he was ten years old. The margins of his school-books
were covered with these his handiworks.'</p>

<p>Rowlandson's genius was of the rapid order, his powers were matured before
the average of students have sounded the direction of their inclinations. Young
Henry Angelo left Doctor Barrow's and Soho Square, for Eton, while Bannister
and Rowlandson quitted the seminary of polite learning to follow the arts at the
Schools of the Royal Academy; here our artist made rapid strides, and gave
convincing proofs of his ability,
dexterity, and quickness of parts,
during the short interval his name
was entered as a probationer.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 333px;">
<img src="images/i_071.png" width="333" height="262" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In his sixteenth year, somewhere
about 1771, Rowlandson had the
advantage of being sent to Paris
to continue his education; we learn
that he 'spoke French like a native.'
It was his aunt, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">n&eacute;e</i> Mademoiselle
Chattelier, residing in the French
metropolis, a widow with what
would have then been considered, in that capital, a handsome fortune, who
invited her hopeful nephew over to the very centre of gaiety, dissipation, and
luxurious refinement&mdash;Paris in the latter days of Louis the Fifteenth's reign
being a very Capua for a youth of light and picturesque disposition such as
our artist possessed. The impulse for purposeless frivolities, so deleteriously
nourished amidst the gaieties of Parisian life, seems to have been kept in
tolerable subjection by his earnest intentions to work hard at his adopted profession,
which certainly must have sustained Master Rolley during his earlier
residence on the Continent, until the cup of pleasure was raised to his lips by
an unexpected accession of means. The student did a wonderful deal of real
solid work and thoroughly steadfast application, before, like Moreland, he
allowed himself to be whirled into the eddy of fashionable distractions; in
Paris he was inscribed as a student in one of the drawing-academies there,
and his natural abilities, aided by the excellence of the methods practised around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_53" id="Page_i_53">[53]</a></span>
him, to which his gifts moulded themselves quite naturally, enabled the probationer
to make rapid advances in the study of the human figure, and laid the
foundation for his future excellences. During his first sojourn, which lasted
for nearly two years, Rowlandson became a perfect French buck, with a decided
leaning, however, towards the fine-art section of the condition, and a pride
in his professional calling; he learned to draw with fidelity to nature, with
the graceful ease, and <em>abandon</em>, and the sparkle of style which marks French
pictorial art of the period immediately antecedent to the reign of Louis the
Sixteenth, the very ideal of luxury and refinement. It is related that, during
his abode in Paris, 'he occasionally permitted his satiric talents the indulgence
of portraying the characteristics of that fantastic people, whose <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">outr&eacute;</i> habits
perhaps scarcely demanded the exaggerations of caricature.'</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 142px;">
<img src="images/i_072.png" width="142" height="245" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Rowlandson returned to London for a season; and, while still a youth in
years, his studies at the Academy were resumed; his progress was now so
marked that he was set up as a friendly rival to Mortimer, another talented
student, who had won the admiration of professors and pupils
alike, by his skilful drawings after the nude figure. Our artist
seems to have been highly popular with the two sections of
academicians and students; the former appreciated his masterly
endowments, the latter were won by his whimsicalities, his
spirit of mischief, and the marvellous gift he possessed of turning
every situation to comical account in the production of exhaustless
graphic satires, which seemed to flow from his pen of their
own sweet wilfulness.</p>

<p>John Bannister, who, as we have seen, had evinced an equal
predilection for the graphic art, with powers, however, of lesser brilliancy, was
then studying in the antique school, their old friendship was renewed, and a
fresh alliance for fun and frolic was straightway entered into.</p>

<p>These hopeful aspirants were a great acquisition to the mirth of the schools,
but both these eccentric geniuses must have sorely tried the patience of their
venerated pastors and masters. The nature of their drolleries, which were incessant,
is exposed in an extract from the <cite>Reminiscences</cite> of Henry Angelo, who
formed the third person of this waggish trio.</p>

<p>'At the period when Wilson held the appointment of Librarian to the Royal
Academy, the students were accustomed to assemble in the library; Bannister
and Rowlandson were students, and both being sprightly wights, Wilson kept a
watchful eye upon their pranks. The one was apt to engage the attention of his
fellow-disciples by caricaturing the surly librarian, never forgetting to exaggerate
his mulberry nose; whilst the other, born to figure in the histrionic art, a mimic
by nature, used to divert them, in his turn, by playing off the irritable 'Old Dick.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_54" id="Page_i_54">[54]</a></span>
Michael Moser was keeper at Somerset House while Bannister and Rowlandson
were students of the Royal Academy, at which period the drawing-school
was held in a part of the old palace, Somerset House, just behind the site of
the present institution. Moser, in virtue of his office as keeper, had apartments
there, which included accommodations for a housekeeper, and other
female domestics.</p>

<p>'Bannister and Rowlandson, as before observed, were prankish youths.
The latter once gave great offence by carrying a pea-shooter into the life
academy, and, whilst old Moser was adjusting the female model, and had just
directed her contour, Rowlandson let fly a pea, which, making her start, she
threw herself entirely out of position, and interrupted the gravity of the study
for the whole evening. For this offence, Master Rowlandson went near getting
himself expelled.</p>

<p>'Bannister, who at this time drew in the plaster academy, not having gained
the step that admitted to the drawing from the life, used to amuse Moser with
his mimicry, and he was, indeed, a pet of the worthy keeper.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 240px;">
<img src="images/i_073.png" width="240" height="139" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'One evening, observing that the student
had vacated his seat at his desk, the keeper
went to seek him, and, hearing an unusual
giggling and confusion in the basement storey
he descended to learn the cause; when he
discovered the young artist romping with the
servant-maids.</p>

<p>'What are you doing, sir, hey?' inquired the keeper, taking him gently by
the ear; 'why are you not at the <em>cast</em>? You are an idler, sir.' Bannister met
his reproof with an arch smile, and whispered, 'No, kind sir, I only came down
to study from the <em>life</em>!'</p>

<p>In dealing with this part of the subject, every scrap of information has its
interest, the resources in this direction being unfortunately most restricted. The
task of writing on Gillray, and that within the lifetime of the subject, was likened
to the toil 'of bondsmen commanded to make bricks without straw,' a comparison
with which we have a lively sympathy, as we have realised to the fullest
extent the difficulties which surrounded that undertaking. The obstacles to be
surmounted in the instance of the first caricaturist are found to be rather more
vexatious in the case of the companion volume, taken up under similar auspices,
to elucidate the works of Rowlandson, and to trace the artist's career as far as
lies within the writer's capabilities. Sixty years ago it was declared while treating
of the first-named genius, in reference to contemporaneous indifference: 'It
is a scandal upon all the cold-hearted scribblers in the land to allow such a
genius as Gillray to go to the grave unnoticed; and a burning shame that so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_55" id="Page_i_55">[55]</a></span>
many of his works should have become ambiguous for want of a commentator.
The political squibs have lost half of their point for want of a glossary, and many
of the humorous traits of private life, so characteristic of men and manners, are
becoming oblivious to ninety-nine hundredths of those who perambulate the streets
of this mighty town.' This remark, so appropriately applied to Gillray (before
Thomas Wright, and successive elucidators, had contributed to render the
reading of these pictorial fables fairly clear, and the solutions easy of access),
is equally striking as respects its undoubted truth in its application to
Rowlandson&mdash;in his instance the pioneering remained to be accomplished&mdash;although
his works are less complex in themselves, a description of them has
hitherto proved too perplexing an attempt, since, how were the subjects to be
collected?</p>

<p>We feel a glow of gratitude to that worthiest old authority, <cite>The Gentleman's
Magazine</cite>, which contained a capital obituary notice on the caricaturist's
decease, April 22, 1827, written by 'one who had known him for more than
forty years;' this article has been copied
literally in all subsequent notices of Rowlandson.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 394px;">
<img src="images/i_074.png" width="394" height="291" alt="" />
</div>

<p>W. H. Pyne, the artist, who, under a
pseudonym as <em>Ephraim Hardcastle</em>, conducted
the earliest of English fine-art reviews,
<cite>The Somerset House Gazette</cite>, 1824, was one of
the intimates of the caricaturist, and he has
left slight allusions to Rowlandson, both in his
<cite>Gazette</cite> and in another publication of his enterprising, <cite>Wine and Walnuts, or
After Dinner Chat</cite>, by Ephraim Hardcastle, 1823.</p>

<p>John Thomas Smith, as we have shown elsewhere, was on terms of personal
friendship with Rowlandson throughout his life; but strangely enough, in his
Nollekens and his Times, and his second volume, <cite>Memoirs of several Contemporary
Artists from the time of Roubiliac, Hogarth and Reynolds, to that of
Fuseli, Flaxman, and Blake</cite>, no mention is made of his much-esteemed associate.
A passing allusion to his 'friend and fellow-pupil' Rowlandson, occurs
in 'Antiquity' Smith's <cite>Book for a Rainy Day</cite>.</p>

<p>Henry Angelo, the early schoolfellow and constant comrade of our artist, a
gentleman of varied accomplishments, obliged the reading public with his
<cite>Reminiscences</cite> in 1830, a chatty, interesting, and in some respects highly valuable
book, of which we wish there were more, since the two volumes are, as described
by the title, filled with <em>memoirs of his friends, including numerous original
anecdotes and curious traits of the most celebrated characters that have flourished
during the last eighty years</em>. Unlike the author of <cite>Nollekens and his Times</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_56" id="Page_i_56">[56]</a></span>
Angelo has given due prominence to his recollections of the caricaturist's works
and career, and his terms of familiar intimacy have supplied him with many
entertaining details, trivial or unimportant in themselves perhaps, but very much
to the purpose from a biographical point of view, as aids to the effort of reproducing
the subject in his wonted aspect, as he struck the men amongst whom he
passed his life. The spirit of Angelo's <cite>Reminiscences</cite> will not bear dilution, and
so we think it better to offer his memoirs of the artist as they were published.</p>

<p>'Thomas Rowlandson, John Bannister, and myself, having early in life
evinced a predilection for the study of drawing, we became acquainted whilst
boys, and were inseparable companions.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 317px;">
<img src="images/i_075.png" width="317" height="174" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'Everyone at all acquainted with the arts must well know the caricature
works of that very eccentric genius, Rowlandson; the extent of his talent,
however, as a draughtsman is not so generally known. His studies from the
human figure at the Royal Academy were made in so masterly a style that he
was set up as a rival to Mortimer, whom he certainly would have excelled, had
his subsequent study kept pace with the fecundity of his invention. His
powers, indeed, were so versatile, and his fancy so rich, that every species of
composition flowed from his pen with
equal facility. His misfortune, indeed,
was, as I have been assured by capable
authorities who noticed his juvenile
progress, that of possessing too
ready an invention; this rare faculty,
strange as it may seem, however desirable
to the poet, often proves the
bane of the painter. "The poet," as Milton says, "can build the lofty rhyme,"
even with a dash of his pen. The painter, however easily he may conceive
the structure of a mighty building&mdash;be it a temple, or be it a ship&mdash;must describe
the subject perfectly with all its parts; he must set to work <em>doggedly</em>, as the
great lexicographer, Johnson, said, and labour at the thing with the patience of
the philosopher. Rowlandson was no philosopher, and so his uncontrollable
spirit, sweeping over the prescribed pale, took its excursive flights and caught
its thema on the wing. Hence I think it may safely be averred that he has
sketched or executed more subjects of real scenes in his original rapid manner,
than any ten artists his contemporaries, and etched more plates than any artist,
ancient or modern.</p>

<p>'Few persons&mdash;judging from the careless style of drawing and etching which
he so fatally indulged in, too soon, after acquiring the first rudiments of his art&mdash;would
believe the possibility of his being the author of some of his earlier
designs; for although all are too slight, yet there are certain subjects of his composition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_57" id="Page_i_57">[57]</a></span>
carried through with a compatibility of style so truly original, and so
replete with painter-like feeling, that Sir Joshua Reynolds and Sir Benjamin
West pronounced them wonders of art.'</p>

<p>On this same head we have the testimony of Ephraim Hardcastle in the
<cite>Somerset House Gazette</cite>. A certain weight, beyond the mere evidence of partiality,
is due to the opinions of such authorities as Henry Angelo and W. H. Pyne, who
at least deserve the credit of understanding the subject; both were familiar with
the best works of their day, and in the case of the latter we respect the opinion
of an artist of wide experience and well-known repute.</p>

<p>'Thomas Rowlandson, the merry wag, he who has covered with his never-flagging
pencil enough of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">charta pura</i> to placard the whole walls of China,
and etched as much copper as would sheathe the British navy. Of his graphic
fun and frolic we have seen, Heaven knows, full many a ponderous folio.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 542px;">
<img src="images/i_076.png" width="542" height="262" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'Master Roley, so friendly dubbed by many an old <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">convive</i>, would have taken
higher flights of art had he so willed, for he could draw with elegance and grace;
for the design, no mind was ever better stored with thought&mdash;no genius more
prolific. Nothing, even allowing for caricature, could exceed in spirit and intelligence
some of the off-hand compositions of this worthy.</p>

<p>'Predilections for outline and the pen have ruined many a genius who would
have done honour to the arts. Mortimer, Porter, and many other artists have
sacrificed their talents and their fame to the indulgence of doing that with the
pen (confound both goose-quill, crow-quill, and the reed!) that should have
occupied that fitter instrument the pencil, aforetime called the painting-brush.'</p>

<p>Angelo affords us occasional glimpses of Rowlandson in Paris, and frequently
alludes to the artist's travels on the Continent. It seems, at various stages of his
career, he roved about sometimes in search of subjects, at others, on parties of
pleasure. We have seen the young student sent to Paris to pursue art; later
on Angelo finds him there, at nineteen, still earnest and hard-working.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_58" id="Page_i_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>'The subjects of his humorous designs were not sought in England alone.
He travelled early in life to France, Flanders, and Holland; and stored his
portfolios with sketches highly characteristic of the habits and manners of the
people, at every town through which he passed. Paris, as viewed under the old
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">r&eacute;gime</i>, opened a prolific source for his imitative powers. Nothing can exceed
the fun and frolic which his subjects display, picked up among every class, from
the court down to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cabaret</i>. He mixed in all societies, and speaking French
fluently, made himself acquainted with the habits of thinking, as well as those of
acting, in that city, where everything to an English eye bore the appearance of
burlesque.</p>

<p>'Hogarth had already pronounced Paris "all begilt and befouled." Rowlandson
found it so; and taking that as a sort of maxim which governed all things,
physical as well as moral, in the polite city, he burlesqued even the burlesque.</p>

<p>'His drawings of <cite><a href="#ITALIAN">The Italian</a></cite> and <cite>The French Family</cite>, from which John Raffael
Smith made engravings, had great merit. My friend John Bannister had one
of the originals. I remember the last time I saw poor Edwin the comedian (I
mean the elder), was on occasion of his wishing me to procure for him these
originals. He was too late in his application, and was obliged to solace himself
with the coloured prints, which were touched upon by the hand of Rowlandson.
They were handsomely framed and hung in his dining-room on the first floor
of one of the houses on the north-east piazza, Covent Garden. They subsequently
became the property of Lord Barrymore.</p>

<p>'It would be difficult to enumerate the many choice subjects which he depicted
even in these first tours to the Continent. Those descriptive of Parisian manners
would now be viewed with tenfold interest, as the general external appearance
of things was infinitely more original and amusing before the period of the commencement
of the Revolution than since. Indeed, I can speak of these changes
from my own observation, whilst two years in that city, and in the midst of its
ever-varying gaieties, more than half a century ago.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>'During my residence there, Rowlandson came over in company with an
Englishman of the name of Higginson, whom he got acquainted with at Dover;
a pleasant companion, but, as it fell out, one who seemed to live on his wits.</p>

<p>'Their arrival in Paris was immediately after the death of Louis the Fifteenth
at the moment of the putting on public mourning (1774). Mr. Higginson had
letters of introduction (like Sylvester Daggerwood) to several persons of distinction,
and resided at an hotel adjacent to my quarters. He sent the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">valet de place</i>
with a civil note to request the loan of my black suit, which he knew would fit
him to a T. On the written assurance that it would be returned in time for me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_59" id="Page_i_59">[59]</a></span>
to pay a promised visit in the evening, I readily consented. Rowlandson lost
sight of him for two days and nights; on the morning of the third day he
returned, and I went, not over well pleased, to demand restitution, when on
entering his apartment, he received me with, "Ah! <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon ami</i>, is it you?" seated
under the frosting powder-puff of a French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">friseur</i>, having his hair frizzled and
powdered <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la mode</i>, in my mourning suit. Rowlandson sketched the group, and
subjoined a motto, "Free and Easy." I had many of the drawings made by my
friend Roly at this time.'</p>

<p>It is most likely that our artist's first contribution to the Royal Academy (it
was the seventh exhibition) arrived from Paris; in 1775 there appeared, under
the catalogue Number 253, a certain drawing entitled <cite>Delilah payeth Sampson a
visit while in prison at Gaza</cite>, by Thomas Rowlandson; the exhibitor's address is
given '<i>at</i> No. 4 Church Street, St. Ann's.'</p>

<p>This, no doubt, like his contributions up to 1784, was of a serious character.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>From 1777 we find Rowlandson settled down to portrait-painting, his address
being given at Wardour Street; his contributions to the Academy were as
<span class="locked">follow:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>It is improbable, however, that the artist's disposition for change would allow
him to vegetate in one spot for any length of time, and we are not surprised to
discover that his tours to the Continent became frequent; as far as we can judge
of his extended travels, it appears it was in 1778&mdash;while his youthful ardour was
still fresh, when his sprightly faculties had not been jaded by the allurements of
fashionable life, and his hand had not been betrayed into the careless execution
which determined some time after his decisive rejection of serious art for the indulgence
of uncompromising caricature&mdash;that he went very earnestly to work;
travelling in Flanders and through the cities of Germany; making clever studies
and finished pictures of the incidents of his journeys; noting the travellers he
encountered, their mode of conveyance, the foreign nobility and their equipages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_60" id="Page_i_60">[60]</a></span>
the townsfolks and the country people, coaches, waggons, and, above all, horses
(which he then drew with great fidelity and spirit from life), as far as the figure
subjects which enlivened his pictures were concerned; while his views were
faithful representations of the places he visited, worked out with the completeness
of landscape art.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 310px;">
<img src="images/i_079.png" width="310" height="178" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The drawings of this period evince the excellence of his talents. There is
sufficient spice of character introduced into the groups, and incidents which
give action to his pictures, to raise his subjects above the average treatment,
but the comic element is subordinated to the general harmony of the whole
conception; and we have every opportunity of forming our opinion, from the
numerous interesting series of studies which have come under our attention,
that it was not until about 1782 that our artist began to cut himself adrift
from the more legitimate occupation of his vast abilities in the regions of serious
art, for the allurements which the readier exercise of his talents as a caricaturist
held out for the indulgence of his eccentric and wayward tendencies. As
we have seen, his early bias was
undoubtedly towards the simply
ludicrous; then intervened his
academic training in London and
Paris, the maturing of his powers
necessitating an immense, and
indeed almost incredible amount
of sterling hard work, such as
fitted him to excel in any branch
of his calling he elected to pursue; followed by an attempt towards his establishment
as a serious artist and portrait-painter, and then a relapse in the direction
of his early impulses. This inclination was fostered by the encouragement of
his friends, and the influence of their example. His cronies were, as was most
natural, the humorous designers. There was the great and gifted Gillray, the
prince of caricaturists, whose works created an impression on the public justified
by their remarkable qualities. The friendship of this man, whose reputation
was so wide, and whose mastery of the situation appeared extraordinary,
encouraged Rowlandson to strike out a pathway in the same direction; bringing
original qualifications to bear on this impetus, which in no degree clashed with
the strongly marked intentions of Gillray's scathing inventions. There was
his constant friend Henry Wigstead, a man of social standing, profusely liberal
in his house, a jovial companion out of doors; who, richly endowed with the
vein of humorous invention allied to powers of observation, and a refined sense
of the beautiful, as well as a ready knack of seizing the comic features of a
situation, entrusted his sketches to Rowlandson, that they might be produced in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_61" id="Page_i_61">[61]</a></span>
fitting form; and to the proper execution of these whimsicalities Rowlandson
willingly lent the full force of his own trained skill. Another amateur of distinction,
whose example and influence must have had considerable weight with our
artist, was Henry Bunbury, the caricaturist, a man of family, of means, and,
above all, of high culture. The celebrated Bunbury seemed formed expressly
to be courted by the most eminent of his contemporaries; he had married one
of the beautiful Miss Hornecks; the Duke and Duchess of York were delighted
with his company; amongst the brilliant assemblies at Wynnstay, Bunbury's
society was the most relished; Walpole, Garrick, Reynolds, and Goldsmith
were constantly laying adulation at his feet, or exchanging gallant little
pleasantries with this favoured child of fortune; West and Reynolds were
respectfully solicitous that he should send his contributions to the Royal
Academy; the writers of the day were given to deplore that the occupations of
town and country life, the court, the hunting-field, and the ceremony of receiving
company at his country-house or paying
visits to the seats of his noble friends, sadly
interfered with the exercise of his artistic
abilities.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 246px;">
<img src="images/i_080.png" width="246" height="216" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The instance of Bunbury, who was Rowlandson's
senior by six years, no doubt had
considerable influence upon our artist's
career; the praise and adulation lavished
upon the amateur sketches of the man of
fashion, and the prophecies which writers
were in the habit of recording, that, if
Bunbury had not, from his birth and station, been indifferent to mere monetary
advantages, the pursuit of his talents must have infallibly produced him a large
access of fortune (which he did not need, by the way, since his means were
ample) possibly helped to turn Rowlandson from quietly persevering in the less
congenial study of portraiture, and induced him to show the public what could
be done in the grotesque walk. Nor must we forget Mitchell the banker,
whose friendship was always at our caricaturist's service, his travelling companion
to the Continent, where Rowlandson and his patron passed for the
veritable representatives of John Bull. There was 'the facetious Nixon,' the
pleasant and witty John, 'a choice member of the celebrated Old British Beef-Steak
Club, honorary secretary, and sometime providore to that society of native
gourmands;' further, like his friend Bunbury, distinguished as a man of talent
and taste, possessed of original gifts in the humorous department of graphic
art, he was an honorary exhibitor at Somerset House for many years: this
gentleman, who had perfected the study of how to get the largest possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_62" id="Page_i_62">[62]</a></span>
amount of enjoyment out of existence, also came to Rowlandson to put his
drawings into acceptable shape, and to introduce his eccentric pleasantries to
the public. Nor must the well-known amateurs and choice spirits, Woodward
and Collings, be omitted from the list of those familiars of the artist who, by
precept and example, encouraged him to devote his accomplishments to the
comic branch. It is not surprising that the tendency of this influence, allied to
the strong original bias natural to our artist, drew him farther away from the
steady pursuit of art, and plunged him into the tempting career of a caricaturist,
a pursuit which held out peculiar attractions to an artist gifted with his whimsical
inclinations. We must do Rowlandson the credit to admit that, at the
outset, he distinguished himself marvellously. His first contributions, under
his changed profession, were by no means discreditable to his great qualifications;
indeed these drawings, from the successful impression they produced
on the public, appeared to justify the resolution the artist had taken, and to
prove that he was evidently more at home in the fanciful branch than any of
his predecessors or contemporaries. In 1784 Rowlandson contributed three
somewhat ambitious subjects to the Royal Academy Exhibition; according to
the Catalogue No. 462, <cite><a href="#ITALIAN">An Italian Family</a></cite>; No. 503, <cite>Vauxhall</cite>; No. 511, <cite>The
Serpentine River</cite>.</p>

<p><cite>Vauxhall Gardens</cite>, which is possibly the best recognised of Rowlandson's
more aspiring compositions, was engraved by R. Pollard, aquatinted, to resemble
the drawing, by F. Jukes, and published under the auspices of John Raphael
Smith, also a convivial companion, a leading spirit amongst the careless souls
who formed Rowlandson's social surroundings; the well-known printseller, who
was 'a jack-of-all-trades' according to his own admission, was celebrated for his
liberality to artists; he personally practised the arts both of engraving and
painting, and he excelled in executing spirited portrait sketches, in crayons, 'miniatures
in large' as they were called, of the fashionable personages of his day.</p>

<p>The Study of <cite>Vauxhall</cite> is replete with character; the persons of the
principal frequenters are, it is believed, portraits of numerous celebrities of
the period.</p>

<p>Angelo, in his <cite>Reminiscences</cite>, which touch upon every topic of the time,
among other interesting allusions, recounts the partiality which he and Rowlandson
entertained for the popular resort of the past, and the attractions which,
according to his admission, its diversions held out to the pair.</p>

<p>'<cite>Vauxhall.</cite>&mdash;I remember the time when Vauxhall (in 1776, the price of admission
being then only one shilling) was more like a bear garden than a rational
place of resort, and most particularly on Sunday mornings.</p>

<p>'It was then crowded from four to six with gentry, demireps, apprentices, shop-boys,
&amp;c. Crowds of citizens were to be seen trudging home with their wives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_63" id="Page_i_63">[63]</a></span>
and children. Rowlandson the artist and myself have often been there, and
he has found plenty of employment for his pencil.</p>

<p>'The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d'&oelig;uvre</i> of his caricatures, which is still in print, is his drawing of
Vauxhall, in which he has introduced a variety of characters known at the time,
particularly that of my old schoolfellow at Eton, Major Topham, the macaroni of
the day. One curious scene he sketched on the spot purposely for me. It was
this:&mdash;A citizen and his family are seen all seated in a box eating supper, when
one of the riffraff in the gardens throws a bottle in the middle of the table,
breaking the dishes and the glasses. The old man swearing, the wife fainting,
and the children screaming, afforded full scope for his humorous pencil.</p>

<p>'Such night scenes as were then tolerated are now become obsolete. Rings
were made in every part of the gardens to decide quarrels; it no sooner
took place in one quarter, than by a contrivance of the light-fingered gentry,
another row was created in another quarter to attract the crowd away.'</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 162px;">
<img src="images/i_082.png" width="162" height="239" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Before taking leave of Rowlandson and Angelo, the
most agreeable of companions, at Vauxhall, we must add
a further note of another of their holiday jaunts, once
more borrowed from the <cite>Reminiscences</cite>.</p>

<p>'Mrs. Weichsel (Mrs. Billington's mother) was the
favourite singer at Vauxhall; upon one occasion she
had her benefit at the little theatre in the Haymarket.
Her daughter and son added considerably to the entertainment
that night; though the former could not have
been fourteen years old, her execution on the pianoforte
surprised everyone. The son, then a little boy, played a
solo on the fiddle in such peculiarly fine style that the audience were both
astonished and delighted. Exhibiting his early abilities standing on a stool, I
was present that night with Rowlandson the artist, who made a sketch of him
playing, which he afterwards finished for me, and which, within these few years,
was within my collection.'</p>

<p>We will leave Rowlandson rejoicing in the popular impression his drawings
had produced in the Exhibition of the Royal Academy for 1784, where, as his
friends were inclined to prophesy, his fame and fortune were both assured, and
turn to the subject of another fortune which seems to have come into his possession
about this period. We have said that the artist was a spoiled child of
prosperity; his contemporaries record their impression that the indulgences of
his aunt, the ex-Mademoiselle Chattelier already referred to, as the kindly
patroness of her wayward nephew's budding talents, who supplied him incautiously
with money, when he would have been better without it, paved the
foundation of those careless habits which attended his manhood; and to her injudicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_64" id="Page_i_64">[64]</a></span>
generosity his biographer affects to trace that improvidence for which, says
our authority, poor Rowlandson was remarkable through life. After this aunt's
decease, she left him seven thousand pounds, much plate, trinkets, and other
valuable property. He then indulged his predilections for a joyous life, and
mixed himself with the gayest of the gay. Whilst at Paris, being of a social
spirit, he sought the company of dashing young men; and among other evils,
imbibed a love for play. He was known in London at many of the fashionable
gaming houses, alternately won and lost, without emotion, till at length he was
minus several thousand pounds. He thus dissipated the amount of more than
one valuable legacy. It was said to his honour, however, that he always
played with the feelings of a gentleman, and his word passed current even
when with an empty purse. Rowlandson assured the writer of the memoir
which appeared, on his death, in the obituary of <cite>The Gentleman's Magazine</cite> for
June 1827, that he had frequently played throughout a night and the next day;
and that once, such was his infatuation for the dice, he continued at the gaming
table nearly thirty-six hours, with the intervention only of the time for refreshment,
which was supplied by a cold collation, presumably consumed on the spot
and during the intervals of play.</p>

<p>This uncontrollable passion for gambling, strange to say, did not pervert his
principles. He was scrupulously upright in all his pecuniary transactions, and
ever avoided getting into debt. He has been known, after having lost all he
possessed, to return home to his professional studies, sit down coolly to produce
a series of new designs, and to exclaim, with stoical philosophy, 'I have played
the fool; but,' holding up his pencils or the reed pen with which he traced his
flowing outlines, 'here is my resource.' Such was his dexterity of hand, combined
with the richest fertility of imagination, and graphic mastery over the movements
of the human figure, that in a few hours he produced inimitable pictures, replete
with his best qualities of humour, form, and colour, with incredible rapidity; and
these ingenious productions, invented in endless variety, were at once put into
circulation, and excited the competition of collectors of drawings and caricatures,
who eagerly accumulated every sketch which his facile hand designed, too often
under the pressure of the actual necessities of the hour, or the careless effusions
of the intervals in his pleasures or dissipations.</p>

<p>It was about this time that our caricaturist met with a somewhat disagreeable
adventure, which is thus related by his friend <span class="locked">Angelo:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>'<cite>Rowlandson robbed.</cite>&mdash;Having walked one night with Rowlandson towards
his house, when he lived in Poland Street,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> we parted at the corner. It was
then about twelve o'clock, and before he got to his door a man knocked him
down, and, placing his knees on his breast, rifled him of his watch and money.
The next day he proposed that we should be accompanied by a thief-taker, to
try to find him out, as he was certain he should know him again. We first
repaired to St. Giles's, Dyot Street, and Seven Dials, but to no purpose. In
one of the night-houses, four ill-looking fellows, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">des coupes-jarrets</i>, so attracted
our attention, that whilst we sat over our
noggin of spirits, as he always carried his
sketch-book with him, he made an excellent
caricature group of them for me, introducing
a prison in the background. An idea may be
formed from the caricature, of the different
gradations which lead to the gallows&mdash;petty
larceny, house-breaking, foot-pad and highway
robbery; and he afterwards finished it for me
in his best style, superior to the greater part
of his works; this was about 1790. The
coloured drawing once was included in my
collection, in a room crowded with various subjects, the greatest part caricatures
by my old friend Rowly&mdash;his general appellation among his friends.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 260px;">
<img src="images/i_084.png" width="260" height="259" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'Our first interview originated in Paris (about 1775); he was then studying in
the French school. Lately, having to dispose of my collection (I may say
unique), my friend Bannister purchased it of me, and it was added to his many
choice and valuable drawings of the first masters, which were so very superior
that the four thieves ought to have esteemed it an honour to be placed in such
good company.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>'The next night a gentleman was robbed in Soho Square in like manner.
Soon afterwards several suspicious characters were taken to an office then in
Litchfield Street, Soho, suspected of street robberies, and Rowlandson and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_66" id="Page_i_66">[66]</a></span>
myself went there out of curiosity, accompanied by many others who had been
robbed. They were all placed before us, but none were identified. Rowlandson
was particularly called upon to look around him, but to no purpose. One man
in particular made himself more conspicuous than all the others, treating his
curiosity with contempt, saying, "I defies the gemman to say as how I ever
stopped him any <em>vare</em>." "No; but you are very like the description of the
ruffian," answered Rowlandson, "who robbed a gentleman last Wednesday night
in Soho Square." This was a thunderbolt to the man, who instantly looked pale
and trembled. The gentleman was immediately sent for, and as soon as he
entered the room, though there were several for examination, he fixed directly
on the man that had been suspected. At the sessions following he was found
guilty of robbery, and hanged. This pleased my friend mightily; "for, though I
got knocked down," said he, "and lost my watch and money, and did not find the
thief, I have been the means of hanging <em>one</em> man. Come, that's doing something."'</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 411px;">
<img src="images/i_085.png" width="411" height="253" alt="" />
</div>

<p>We incidentally learn a few particulars of subjects which found their way into
Angelo's gallery, the collection which subsequently came into the possession of
his excellent friend Bannister.</p>

<p>'<cite>Black and White.</cite>&mdash;Being fond of the arts and particularly of caricatures,
I had by me a great number of Rowlandson's, to one of which I was puzzled
to give a name. The subject was an old man, at breakfast, seated near the fire,
his gouty leg on a stool, and the kettle boiling over; the water is falling
on his leg, and he is ringing the bell. The room door is open behind him,
and a black servant is kissing the maid, who is bringing in the toast. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_67" id="Page_i_67">[67]</a></span>
requested Theodore Hook to write a title to it, and he put, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chacun à son
goût</i>."'<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>We are further afforded an opportunity of recording Rowlandson's enthusiasm
for his profession. The details of a certain visit he paid, with Angelo, to
Portsmouth, and the unflinching nerve he exhibited under circumstances which
were calculated to distress a less robust constitution, are thus recounted by his
friend and travelling <span class="locked">companion:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>'The general rumour, after Lord Howe's action on June 1, 1794, was that
he would return to Portsmouth. I was anxious to see the sight, for it was
expected he would bring the French prizes with him.</p>

<p>'The evening after my arrival, according to promise, Rowlandson the artist
came to join me.</p>

<p>'The morning following we saw, on the Gosport side, the landing of the
French prisoners, numbers of different divisions filing off to the different stations
allotted them. As for the wounded, previous to their quitting the boats, carts
were placed alongside, and when filled, on the smack of the whip, were ordered
to proceed. The sudden jolting made their groans appalling, and must have
occasioned the wounds of many to produce an immediate hemorrhage. The
sight was dreadful to behold: numbers were boys, mutilated, some not more
than twelve years old, who had lost both legs. In the evening we went to
Forton Prison. Those who were not in the last engagement were in high spirits
in their shops, selling all sorts of toys and devices, made from shin-bones, &amp;c.
In one of the sick-wards we saw one of the prisoners, who, an officer told us
had been a tall, handsome man, previous to the battle; but, having received a
shot that had lacerated his side, a mortification had taken place. He was then
making his will; his comrades were standing by, consoling him, some grasping
his hand, shedding tears.</p>

<p>'This scene was too much for me, and made such an impression on my mind
that I hastened away; but I could not persuade Rowlandson to follow me, his
inclination to make a sketch of the dying moment getting the better of his
feelings. After waiting some time below for my friend, he produced a rough
sketch of what he had seen:&mdash;a ghastly figure sitting up in bed, a priest holding
a crucifix before him, with a group standing around. The interior exhibited the
contrivance of the French to make their prison habitable. When finished, it
was added to my collection, a memento of the shocking sight I beheld at Forton
Prison.</p>

<p>'Our curiosity not stopping here, we entered another sick-ward, but the stench
and closeness of the place, crowded as it was, prevented our remaining there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_68" id="Page_i_68">[68]</a></span>
more than a very short time. The next day, having seen quite enough, I
returned to town. Rowlandson went to Southampton, where he made a number
of sketches of Lord Moira's embarkation for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Vend&eacute;e</i>. I saw them afterwards,
and was delighted, for it appeared he had taken more pains than usual, and he
must have portrayed them well, from having been on the spot himself at the
time. The shipping and the various boats filled with soldiers were so accurately
delineated, that I have often since regretted that I did not at that time purchase
them. Mr. Fores of Piccadilly, who had by him many of the very finest drawings
executed by Rowlandson in his best days (for latterly they were inferior),
fortunately purchased them. He was one of his first and best patrons; and I
understand he had twenty-five folio volumes of the most choice caricatures of the
last and present centuries, which must have been an invaluable <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">recueil</i>, showing
not only what we have been, but the age we lived in. Had Rowlandson gone
with the expedition then landing in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Vend&eacute;e</i> as a draughtsman, the attack at
Fort Penthièvre, and the incident that followed, would have furnished us with
many eventful scenes of that fatal expedition.'</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 232px;">
<img src="images/i_087.png" width="232" height="197" alt="" />
</div>

<p>As we have related, Rowlandson was no
stranger to the Continent; in the early part of
his career he was constantly abroad. We have
shown how he studied in Paris; afterwards we
find him wandering farther afield, and taking
in Germany and the Netherlands. Then we
are introduced to him as a man of fashion,
bowling through the legacies which had fallen
to his lot, both in the French metropolis and
in London, calmly sitting down to gamble away his fortune by the shortest route
with the best will in the world. Anon he accompanies his friend Mitchell the
banker on a wider tour. Then we hear of his sojourning in Paris with other
congenial spirits, and making the most of the passing season with his friends
John Raphael Smith, Westmacott, and Chasemore: on all these occasions he
produced drawings innumerable; his most frequent travelling companion seems,
however, to have been his steadfast patron the banker, and it was this liberal
collector who rejoiced in the opportunity of securing the artist's most desirable
Continental studies. Our oft-quoted authority Angelo, who, happily for those
who entertain an interest in the caricaturist, never tires of telling little anecdotes
of his chum Roley, in his own familiar manner relates a few particulars
of the figure these worthies made in the eyes of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieurs</i>, amongst whom
their visits were favourably received.</p>

<p>'Mr. Mitchell, however, possessed the best collection of Rowlandson's French
and Dutch scenes. Among those were many in his most humorous style, particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_69" id="Page_i_69">[69]</a></span>
a <cite>Dutch Life Academy</cite>, which represents the interior of a school of
artists, studying from a living model, all with their portfolios and crayons,
drawing a Dutch Venus (a <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">vrow</i>) of the make, though not of the colour, of that
choice specimen of female proportion, the <cite>Hottentot Venus</cite>, so celebrated as a
public sight in London, a few years since.</p>

<p>'This friend and patron of Rowlandson, Mr. Mitchell the quondam banker, of
the firm of Hodsol and Co., was a facetious, fat gentleman&mdash;one of those pet
children of fortune, who, wonderful as it may appear, seem to have proceeded
through all the seven ages (excepting that of the <em>lean</em> and slippered pantaloon),
without a single visit from that intruder upon the rest of mankind, yclept <em>Care</em>.
In him centred, or rather around him the Fates piled up, the wealth of a whole
family. He was ever the great gathering <em>nucleus</em> to a large fortune. He was
good-humoured and enjoyed life. Many a cheerful day have I, in company
with Bannister and Rowlandson, passed at Master Mitchell's.'</p>

<p>Under the auspices of this great banker, Rowlandson subsequently made a
tour to France, and other parts of the Continent. 'His mighty stature astonished
the many, but none more than the innkeepers' wives, who, on his arrival, as
he travelled in style, looked at the larder, and then again at the guest. All
regarded him as that reported being, of whom they had heard, the veritable
Mister Bull. His orders for the supplies of the table, ever his first concern,
strengthened this opinion, and his operations at his meals confirmed the fact.</p>

<p>'Wherever he went he made good for the house.</p>

<p>'On this tour, Rowlandson made many topographical drawings, in general
views of cities and towns; amongst others, the High Street at Antwerp, and the
Stadt House at Amsterdam, with crowds of figures, grouped with great spirit,
though his characters were caricatures.</p>

<p>'The most amusing studies, however, which filled the portfolio of his patron
were those that portrayed the habits and customs of the Dutch and Flemish, in
the interior scenes, which they witnessed in their nocturnal rambles in the inferior
streets at Antwerp and Amsterdam. Some of these compositions, drawn
from low life, were replete with character and wit. One of the most spirited and
amusing of these represented the interior of a <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Treischuit</i>, or public passage-boat,
which was crowded with incident and humour.'<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Another reminiscence of Rowlandson and Mitchell is found in the <cite>Somerset-house
Gazette</cite>, edited by Ephraim Hardcastle (W. H. Pyne), an intimate associate
of the caricaturist and a member of the artist's circle of friends.</p>

<p>'I look back with pleasure to former days, when old Mr. Greenwood used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_70" id="Page_i_70">[70]</a></span>
to hold the print auctions by candle-light, and have a perfect recollection of his
good-humour and upright dealing. I well remember, too, a number of artists and
amateurs who constantly attended his room, to purchase etchings of the old
masters for themselves and friends.</p>

<p>'Old Parsons, as he was called, and young Bannister, the celebrated comedians,
were both collectors and amateur artists: the latter was considered an excellent
judge of prints. Rowlandson, the humorous draughtsman, and his friend and
patron Mr. Mitchell the banker, of the firm of Hodsols, were also frequently of
this evening rendezvous of artists, amateurs, and connoisseurs.'</p>

<p>John Thomas Smith, the whilom pupil of Nollekens the sculptor (with whose
life he favoured the public), and one of Mr. Reid's predecessors as Keeper of the
Print Room of the British Museum, in his loquacious <cite>Book for a Rainy Day</cite>
rambles into the subject of picture sale-rooms, and notes the eccentric characters,
collectors, and their individualities, to be met with thereat in his time. On this
subject 'Antiquity Smith's' account tallies with that given by Angelo. We have
confined our extract to the paragraph which introduces the caricaturist as a crony
and erst fellow-pupil of the versatile chronicler.</p>

<p>'I must not omit to mention another singular but most honourable character,
of the name of Heywood, nick-named "Old Iron-wig." His dress was precise,
and manner of walking rather stiff. He was an extensive purchaser of every
kind of article in art, particularly Rowlandson's drawings; for this purpose he
employed the merry and friendly Mr. Seguier, the picture-dealer, a school-fellow
of my father's, to bid for him.</p>

<p>'I shall now close this list by observing that my friend and fellow-pupil,
Rowlandson, who has frequently made drawings of Hutchins and his print
auctions, has produced a most spirited etching, in which not only many of the
above described characters are introduced, but also most of the print-sellers of
his day.'</p>

<p>The editor of this work has seen a drawing by Rowlandson of this very
auction, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cognoscenti</i> gathered round the long tables lighted with flickering
candles, and peering over the engravings, glasses on nose, while the auctioneer
was endeavouring to excite the interest of the company in the prints brought
to his rostrum.</p>

<p>Before we pass on to other contemporaries of the caricaturist, we think it
advisable to introduce the reader to the society which Rowlandson shared round
the hospitable mahogany of the banker, who, like Wigstead, Nixon, Weltj&eacute;, and
certain other generous hosts of our artist's acquaintance, appears to have kept open
house for the entertainment of choice friends, where the enjoyments of social
intercourse were prolonged to the verge of dissipation, and the fun, which enlivened
their hours of relaxation, was frequently kept up until the next day was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_71" id="Page_i_71">[71]</a></span>
well advanced; the associates being loth to interrupt the pleasures of their
sitting, protracted as their gaieties might be considered according to the more staid
usages of a better regulated age, such as we have been taught to regard our own.</p>

<p>'Mr. Mitchell resided for many years in Beaufort Buildings, Strand, and
occupied the house tenanted by the father of Dr. Kitchiner, of eccentric memory.
Here, after the closing of the banking-house, he was wont to retire, and pass a
social evening, surrounded by a few chosen associates whose amusements were
congenial, and whose talent well paid the host for his hot supper and generous
wine. Often, even beyond the protracted darkness of a winter's night, he and
his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">convives</i> have sat it out till dawn of day, and seen the sun, struggling through
the fog, from the back windows, shed its lurid ray on the rippling waters of the
murky Thames.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 242px;">
<img src="images/i_090.png" width="242" height="158" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'Well do I remember sitting in this comfortable apartment, listening to the
stories of my old friend Peter Pindar, whose wit seemed not to kindle until
after midnight, at the period of about his fifth or sixth glass of brandy and
water. Rowlandson, too, having nearly accomplished his twelfth glass of punch,
and replenishing his pipe with choice <em>oronooko</em>,
would chime in. The tales of these
two gossips, told in one of these nights, each
delectable to hear, would make a modern
<em>Boccaccio</em>.'</p>

<p>Angelo, in his capital chatty <cite>Memoirs</cite>,
relates an anecdote of one of Wigstead's
pranks played off on the satirist Peter Pindar,
whose trenchant wit spared 'nor friend nor foe;' but, in his turn, Dr. Wolcot
did not relish ridicule, especially when it happened to be excited at his own
expense. It was discovered that, eminently satirical as was the bard with his
pen, he was not emulous to shine as a wit in colloquial intercourse with strangers,
or even amongst his most intimate associates. It was asserted, with some fidelity,
that 'Dr. Wolcot's wit seemed to lie in the bowl of a teaspoon.' 'I could not
guess the riddle,' writes the discursive and cheerful author of the <cite>Reminiscences</cite>,
'until one evening, seated at Mitchell's, I observed that each time Peter replenished
his glass goblet with cognac and water, that, in breaking the sugar, the
corners of his lips were curled into a satisfactory smile, and he began some
quaint story&mdash;as if, indeed, the new libation begot a new thought.</p>

<p>'Determined to prove the truth of the discovery which I fancied I had made,
one night after supper, at my own residence in Bolton Row, he being one among
a few social guests, I made my promised experiment. One of the party, who
delighted in a little practical joke, namely Wigstead, of merry memory, being
in the secret, he came provided with some small square pieces of alabaster.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_72" id="Page_i_72">[72]</a></span>
Peter Pindar's glass waning fast, Wigstead contrived to slip the fragments of
spurious sweetness into a sugar-basin provided for the purpose, when the Doctor
reaching the hot water, and pouring in the brandy, Wigstead handed him the
sugar-tongs, and then advanced the basin of alabaster. "Thank you, boy," said
Peter, putting in five or six pieces, and taking his tea-spoon, began stirring as he
commenced his story.</p>

<p>'Unsuspicious of the trick, he proceeded: "Well, sirs,&mdash;and so, the old
parish-priest.&mdash;What I tell you (then his spoon went to work) happened when I
was in that infernally hot place, Jamaica (then another stir). Sir, he was the
fattest man on the island (then he pressed the alabaster); yes, damme, sir; and
when the thermometer, at ninety-five, was dissolving every other man, this old
slouching, drawling, son of the Church got fatter and fatter, until, sir&mdash;curse
the sugar! some devil-black enchanter has bewitched it. By &mdash;&mdash; sir, this sugar
is part and parcel of that old pot-bellied parson&mdash;it will never melt;" and he
threw the contents of the tumbler under the grate. We burst into laughter, and
our joke lost us the conclusion of the story. Wigstead skilfully slipped the
mock sugar out of the way, and the Doctor, taking another glass, never suspected
the frolic.'</p>

<p>Let us take a further glimpse of the social meetings which Rowlandson shared
in company with Angelo, who duly set down the outlines of the evenings'
diversions in his <cite>Memoirs</cite>. As this anecdote introduces a personage who figures
somewhat prominently amidst the more lively records of the period, we must be
allowed to say a word or two about the giver of the feast, where we are admitted
by favour and enabled to watch the proceedings from a distance.</p>

<p>Another excellent friend, occasional host, and boon companion of our
caricaturist was, as we have mentioned, Weltj&eacute;, the Prince of Wales' cook and
steward, a German of eccentric proclivities, who was pretty universally recognised
as a character in his generation. The huge person of this worthy is
frequently introduced into the social satires of the period; the artistic and literary
wags alike delighted to make the figure of the old <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon-vivant</i> conspicuous; it
seems that Weltj&eacute; was in no wise offended at this popularity, however unflattering
might be the intentions of the wicked wights; he was a calm humoristic
philosopher, whose composure was not easily deranged, and in return for their
mischievous sallies, which only amused him, he made the wits, who grew waggish
at his expense, his guests at his residence Hammersmith Mall; where he kept
such a table as attracted all classes of society, and to which his friends were ever
welcome. Weltj&eacute;'s culinary accomplishments, united with his hospitable proclivities,
rendered him a truly remarkable host; his good humour was imperturbable,
his store of anecdotes inexhaustible, and his German bluntness rather added to
the charm of his pleasantries; even that superfine Sybarite and highly sensitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_73" id="Page_i_73">[73]</a></span>
exquisite, the Heir Apparent, Mr. Weltj&eacute;'s patron and employer, was glad to
dissemble his offended dignity when his precious and immovable cook was the
assailant. Angelo, who declares he owed many a convivial day to the kindness
of this rough diamond, assures us in his <cite>Reminiscences</cite>: 'Whether at Carlton
House or his own, Weltj&eacute; was always remarkable for singularity. I have been
told that when Alderman Newnham was one day dining at Carlton House, the
Prince said to him, "Newnham, don't you think there is a strange taste in the
soup?" "It appears so to me, your highness." "Send for Weltj&eacute;." When Weltj&eacute;
made his appearance, the Prince observed that the soup had a strange taste.
Weltj&eacute; called to one of the pages, "Give me de <em>spoone</em>," and putting it in the
tureen, after tasting it several times, said, "Boh! boh! tish very goote," and
immediately left the room, leaving the spoon on the table, without taking further
notice of the complaint.'</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 278px;">
<img src="images/i_092.png" width="278" height="209" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It is not, however, with the worthy Weltj&eacute; at Carlton House, but at his own
villa, that we have to deal. Angelo
introduces us to a capital
dinner-party which took place at
Hammersmith Mall, when the old
associates, Rowlandson, Bannister,
and Munden, were among the
guests; Madame Banti the opera-singer,
and Taylor, also of the
Opera House, with Mr. Palmer of
Bath, contributed to make up a
tolerably festive party. The dinner
was long and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bien recherch&eacute;</i>; the
dishes choice, and cooked in superior style; the sprightly conversation, in which
the company delighted, had been somewhat suspended during the discussion of
a great variety of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entremets</i>, which were duly appreciated by all the guests, and
especially by Madame Banti, who not only tasted of every dish, but, in addition
to a quantity of strong ale, drank a bottle of champagne. The guests were preparing
for that flow of wine and conversation which were the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">agr&eacute;mens</i> of social
intercourse at the period. The repast was concluded as everyone imagined,
and nobody felt disposed to touch another morsel, when Weltj&eacute;'s grand piece of
the entertainment made its appearance&mdash;a huge boar's head, at which delicacy
everyone stared in consternation.</p>

<p>Weltj&eacute; plunged into his element, mixing up <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sauces piquantes</i> at table, of such
ingredients as oil, lemon, cayenne, and different concomitants.</p>

<p>The guests, already lavishly regaled, were inclined to expostulate. 'Indeed,
Weltj&eacute;, we have had more than enough.' 'Boh!' responds the entertainer,
'I vill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_74" id="Page_i_74">[74]</a></span>
make you all hungry again; two heads gomed to dis gontry, von for me, toder
for de Queen, dat de Prince of Bronsvick sent;' and away proceeded the compounding
of sauces. The long interval occupied in Weltj&eacute;'s culinary preparations
was shortened by droll anecdotes, peculiar to his own description, introduced for
the purpose of distracting the attention. Such was his account of his adventure
on his return home to Hammersmith, in his carriage, from Carlton House.
'Fon I gote to de fost dumbpike beyond Kensington, from town, de goach
stobed some time, fon me say, "Godam, ged on:" fon de dumbike say, "Sir, dere
be nobody on de bokes." I was very much fraightened, so I did ged up mine-self.
The next day gome de goachman: "Pray, sir, fon am I to ged the carriage
ready?" "Tartifle, what become of you last night?"' The coachman, it appears,
had fallen off the box in a drunken stupor; unhurt, he had, never troubling himself
about his charge, taken a nap all night under a hedge, and attended on his
master the next morning to receive orders as coolly as if nothing unusual had
happened. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sauce piquante</i> is ready by the time the host has raised a few
laughs; clean plates are handed round; a large dish is filled with slices of the
boar's head, swimming in provocative mixtures; and the guests fall to again;
verifying, as Angelo relates, the French proverb that, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l'app&eacute;tit vient en mangeant</i>,
or, as Hamlet says, 'As if increase of appetite had grown with what it fed on.'
The second repast proved so excellent that the plates were continually replenished.
The poets, painters, actors, musicians, and others, who crowded Weltj&eacute;'s
liberal entertainments, with 'those whose superior station was more suited to a
palace,' then gave themselves up to unrestrained mirthfulness. The dinner
Angelo describes will serve as a type of the many similar entertainments at
which our caricaturist assisted. With the dessert Madame Banti became somewhat
lively, from her repeated libations of champagne, being, as Angelo informs
us, 'in higher spirits than any French woman I had ever seen. With the
enthusiasm of a true John Bull, she sang "God save the King," that she might
have been heard on the other side of the river. Munden, whom she had never
seen before, sang the "Old Woman of Eighty;" and to give effect to the song, tied
his pocket-handkerchief round his head, though his superior humour needed no
addition. When he had finished his song, Banti left her seat in ecstasy, and
went to the other side of the table, where he and I were sitting, and was so
pleased with his mummery (it could be nothing else, for Joe never was an
Adonis), that she came behind his chair and kissed him; which, however, did
not excite a blush, but an agreeable surprise. What with the songs, the choice
wines, the delicious fruits (from Weltj&eacute;'s hothouse), and the zest given to the
entertainment by Banti, it formed such a delightful treat, that the evening passed
too quickly, and it was time to depart long before we were sated with "the feast
of reason and the flow of soul."'</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_75" id="Page_i_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>To return to the working life of our caricaturist: it must be borne in mind
that Rowlandson's journeys were not confined to the Continent; from drawings
which have come under our attention, we find he must have seen the Lakes; it
is highly probable that he paid a visit to Henry Bunbury, who, towards the close
of his life, settled at Keswick, where he died in 1811. We also know, from his
works, that our artist was familiar with England and Wales: his tours, with his
friend Henry Wigstead, have produced many interesting <em>souvenirs</em>; we have
described how they travelled to Wales, and how, too, they saw Cheshire, Cornwall,
Devon, and Somerset; we find them scampering off to the newly established
Brighthelmstone, and to the more old-fashioned watering-places on the
coast of Kent. It was at Margate that Rowlandson lost his most congenial
associate, who having gone there, in the autumn of 1800, for the benefit of his
health, did not live to return; the death of Henry Wigstead was a serious
bereavement to the caricaturist, the earliest of those losses of his cherished associates
which influenced his spirits considerably.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 215px;">
<img src="images/i_094.png" width="215" height="223" alt="" />
</div>

<p>We can also catch glimpses of Rowlandson on
the Scarborough coast, and in Norfolk. Yarmouth
seems to have been a favourite spot with him. We
find him studying at seaports along the south coast;
with Plymouth, Portsmouth, and Southampton he
was thoroughly familiar. Of the Thames and the
Medway, and the shipping to be encountered thereon
in war-time, he has left sketches innumerable; he
has visited the fishing spots on the former, and
drawn the pretty towns which mark the valley of the river. With London, and
its diversified spots of interest, from east to west, and north to south&mdash;the
centre, and the outskirts alike&mdash;he had the most intimate acquaintance. We
have already spoken of the drawings he made in the two University cities, and
his series of views of the noble colleges.</p>

<p>An Historical Sketch of the Art of Caricaturing was written by the well-known
antiquarian J. P. Malcolm, F.S.A., and published in 1813. This book,
which might, had the author so willed, have supplied the curious with valuable
hints, drawn from personal acquaintance, concerning professors of the art then
living, is confined to the briefest recapitulation, as far as concerns contemporary
works, the book being retrospective in principle; and it is difficult to discover
any allusions of value to those Caricaturists lately deceased or who were still
alive. Malcolm's appreciation of grotesque art was somewhat catholic, but he
does not seem as familiar as might reasonably be supposed the case, with the
masterpieces of the men who were flourishing in his time, or perhaps their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chefs
d'&oelig;uvre</i> were then so generally familiar as to need no further recognition. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_76" id="Page_i_76">[76]</a></span>
compiler of the Historical Sketch was evidently an amateur of humorous productions,
and could describe the progress of grotesques, but he does not seem to
have completely carried out the scheme of his treatise.</p>

<p>We have borrowed a paragraph from this excellent antiquarian, as an instance
of his criticisms on the subject of the present volume.</p>

<p>'<cite>Rowlandson's Views in Oxford and Cambridge</cite>, 1810, deserve notice for the
slight and pleasing manner with which he has characterised the architecture of
the places mentioned; but it is impossible to surpass the originality of his figures;
the dance of students and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">filles de joie</i> before Christ Church College is highly
humorous, and the enraged tutors grin with anger peculiar to this artist's pencil.
The professors, in the view of the Observatory at Oxford, are made as ugly as
baboons, and yet the profundity of knowledge they possess is conspicuous at the
first glance; and we should know them to be Masters of Arts without the aid
of the background. The scene in Emanuel College Garden, Cambridge,
exhibits the learned in a state of relaxation; several handsome lasses remove
apples from a tree, and the indolent curiosity
with which they are viewed by these sons of
ease is very characteristic.'</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 284px;">
<img src="images/i_095.png" width="284" height="219" alt="" />
</div>

<p>While considering Rowlandson in relation
to his contemporaries, we have chiefly to deal
with those gifted gentlemen who were, like
himself, generally spoken of in their generation
as <em>caricaturists</em>, and to whose works our
artist was able, from his more considerable
acquirements, to give a presentable form, and
put into circulation through the medium of his proficiency with the etching-needle.</p>

<p>Foremost among these we must speak of Henry Bunbury, so many of whose
felicitous conceptions have derived additional force and popularity alike through
the agency of our artist.</p>

<p>In speaking of the caricaturist's treatment of these amateur works, we are
glad to be able to offer our readers the respectable testimony of Thomas Wright
in support of our own modest opinion, with which intention we quote a few
paragraphs from our late friend's <cite>History of Caricature and Grotesque in Literature
and Art</cite>.</p>

<p>'At various periods certain of Bunbury's designs were engraved by Rowlandson,
who always transferred his own style to the drawings he copied. A
remarkable instance of this is furnished by a print of a party of anglers of both
sexes in a punt, entitled <cite>Anglers of 1811</cite> (the year of Bunbury's death). But
for the name, "H. Bunbury, del.," very distinctly inscribed upon it, we should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_77" id="Page_i_77">[77]</a></span>
take this to be a genuine design by Rowlandson; and in 1803 Rowlandson
engraved some copies of Bunbury's prints on horsemanship for Ackermann, of the
Strand, in which all traces of Bunbury's style are lost.</p>

<p>'There was much of Bunbury's style in that of Woodward, who had a taste
for the same broad caricatures on society, which he executed in a similar spirit.
Some of the <em>suites</em> of subjects of this description that he published, such as the
series of the <cite>Symptoms of the Shop</cite>, those of <cite>Everybody out of Town</cite>, and <cite>Everybody
in Town</cite>, and the specimens of <cite>Domestic Phrensy</cite>, are extremely clever and
amusing. Woodward's designs were also not unfrequently engraved by Rowlandson,
who, as usual, imprinted his own style upon them. A very good example
of this practice is seen in the print entitled <cite>Desire</cite>, in which the passion is
exemplified in the case of a hungry school-boy, watching through a window a
jolly cook carrying by a tempting plum pudding. We are told in an inscription
underneath: "Various are the ways this passion might be depicted; in this
delineation the subjects chosen are
simple&mdash;a hungry boy and a plum
pudding." The design of this print
is stated to be Woodward's; but the
style is altogether that of Rowlandson,
whose name appears on it as the
etcher. It was published by R. Ackermann
on January 20, 1800.'</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 296px;">
<img src="images/i_096.png" width="296" height="258" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In transferring the works of other
caricaturists to the copper, Rowlandson
was in the habit of giving his own
style to them in such a degree that
nobody would suspect they were not
his own if the name of the designer were not attached to them.</p>

<p>We cannot take leave of the Caricaturists without offering a few slight particulars
concerning the respective careers of the most eminent and appreciated
practitioners of the graphic art in its grotesque bearings.</p>

<p>The fecundity of invention displayed in the works of Henry Bunbury
entitles him to rank among the first in this class of designers. The happy
faculty which he possessed of 'reading character at sight,' and the rare felicity
with which he could embody whatever his observation or fancy suggested,
with that scrambling style which was entirely his own, evince that he was born
with a genius to make a figure in this pursuit. This gentleman may be instanced
as a proof, too, that where there is an original faculty for any peculiar art, it will
develop itself, though the possessor may be entirely unacquainted with the
scientific principles of art. Nothing could be farther removed from legitimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_78" id="Page_i_78">[78]</a></span>
art than the style exhibited in the drawings of Bunbury; yet no one has hit off
the peculiarities of character, or expressed with less exaggeration those traits
which constitute the burlesque. Bunbury, indeed, may be said to have steered
his humorous course between sterling character and caricature. When he
appears to outrage nature by representing distortion of figure or form, the fault
is not intentional. Those who have not properly studied the drawing of the
human figure, must occasionally, in spite of themselves, render their objects
preternatural.</p>

<p>It should be added, in honour to the memory of this gentleman, that he
never used his pencil at the expense of personal feeling. His satire upon the
French people was not individual, but national; and the characters which he
introduced in his humorous designs at home, were characteristic of a class, but
never the individuals of a species.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/i_097.jpg" width="150" height="151" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Henry William Bunbury, the caricaturist, was born in 1750. He was educated
at Westminster, whence he was removed to St. Catherine's Hall, Cambridge.
On leaving the university he devoted himself, with some enthusiasm,
to the fine arts. He was passionately fond of out-door
sports, and, as in the instance of Leech in our own days,
the saddle held out attractions superior even to the
pleasure of exercising his fancy. His contemporaries were
much given to deplore that he preferred the excitement of
risking his neck in the hunting field to the cultivation of
the profession his skill should have adorned. His taste
and invention were admired not only by the most gifted
and elevated persons of his time, but artists and critics alike lavished their
encomiums on the favoured designer. Horace Walpole coveted the sketches
which Bunbury exhibited on the walls of the Academy, while Sir Joshua
Reynolds and Sir Benjamin West combined to pay their finest compliments
to the artist, and to publish abroad their flattering sense of his merits. Bunbury
appears to have spent the greater part of his time on the estates belonging
to his family, varied by trips to the Continent and visits to his patrons the
Duke and Duchess of York, at Richmond and other residences, with occasional
sojourns in Wales, the scenery of which had considerable attractions for his sense
of the picturesque. He was a frequent guest of Sir W. W. Wynne, and his
pencil has celebrated the theatrical gatherings at Wynnstay. We also meet him
in town, surrounded by illustrious friends, and we find Goldsmith, Garrick, and
other notabilities corresponding with the kindly and generous caricaturist during
his sojourns at his country seat.</p>

<p>Henry Bunbury was married, August 26, 1771, to Catherine, daughter of
Kane William Horneck, Esq., lieutenant-colonel of the army of Sicily. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_79" id="Page_i_79">[79]</a></span>
lady bore him two sons, and one of them, Sir Henry Bunbury, we believe,
represented the county of Suffolk in Parliament, after the decease of his uncle
Sir Thomas Charles Bunbury, who had previously enjoyed the distinction.
Bunbury, the artist, was elected lieutenant-colonel of the West Suffolk regiment
of militia. His manners were most popular, and it was remarked that he carried
his cheerful and vivacious spirit into every society he frequented. He died at
Keswick, in Cumberland, where he had settled towards the close of his life,
and his sketches of the mountain scenery in his vicinity are said to have displayed
the hand of a master, and to have gained universal appreciation for their
effect and truthfulness.</p>

<p>As a delineator of character, it is stated 'that his sketches approached
nearest to Hogarth of any painter of his period, in the representation of life and
manners; his pencil never transgresses the limits of good taste and delicacy, and
had he been under the necessity of pursuing art for profit, instead of amusement
and pleasure only, he would probably have made a great fortune by the produce
of his genius, which the print-sellers have found a lucrative source of gain,
engravings and etchings after his works having always been eagerly demanded.'</p>

<p>The high estimation in which the caricaturist was personally held is confirmed
by the obituary notice which appeared on his decease in the <cite>Gentleman's
Magazine</cite>; the praise seems to be spontaneous, and its object, from all we can
gather, richly merited the friendly testimony.</p>

<p>'May 7, 1811.&mdash;At Keswick, Henry William Bunbury, Esq., second son of
the Rev. Sir William Bunbury, Bart., of Mildenhall, and of Great Barton, in the
county of Suffolk, and brother to the present Sir Thomas Bunbury, Bart. He
was distinguished at a very early age by a most extraordinary degree of taste
and knowledge in the fine arts. The productions of his own pencil have, from
his childhood, been the admiration and delight of the public. The exquisite
humour of some of his drawings, and the grace and elegance of the rest, were
unrivalled; and he is, perhaps, the only instance in which excellences of such
various and almost opposite character have been united in the same subject in
an equal degree. But though he possessed in this respect a peculiar genius, he
neglected no branch of polite literature. He was a good classical scholar, and
"endowed with the love of sacred song." The Muses were to him <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dulces ante
omnia</i>. He was an excellent judge of poetry; and the specimens remaining of
his own composition put it beyond a doubt that he would have been as eminent
with his pen as with his pencil, if his natural modesty, underrating his own
powers, had not prevented him from pursuing it with more application. These
accomplishments were conspicuous, and obtained for him universal esteem. His
social and moral qualities, while any of those remain who shared his friendship,
will continue the objects of fond admiration and regret. No ribaldry, no profaneness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_80" id="Page_i_80">[80]</a></span>
no ill-natured censure, ever flowed from his lips, but his conversation
abounded in humour and pleasantry; it was charming to persons of all descriptions.
No one was ever in his company without being pleased with him; none
ever knew him without loving him. His feelings were the most benevolent, his
affections the most delicate, his heart the most sincere. He was void of all
affectation, alive to praise, but not obtrusively courting it. Conscious, but not
ostentatious of merit; of unblemished honour; full of that piety and liberal-handed
charity which influences the heart, and seeks the witness, not of the
world, but of his Maker.'</p>

<p>The writer of the obituary notice expressed a conviction, confirmed, as he
stated, by an intimacy of fifty years' <span class="locked">standing:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>'All who had,' concludes the memorial, 'the slightest acquaintance with him,
will bear witness to the extraordinary tenderness of his disposition, to his kind
and active friendship, to his
universal benevolence, practically
displayed through his
entire career.'</p>

</div>

<p>The name of Woodward
occurs so frequently in caricatures
to which <em>Rowlandson
sculpsit</em> is added, that our
readers will probably not consider
the following sketch of
this eccentric gifted celebrity
either out of place, or entirely
superfluous.</p>

<p>Recapitulating his recollections of humorous artists, Angelo informs us that&mdash;'The
inventive genius of one burlesque designer was exhaustless&mdash;George Moutard
Woodward, commonly designated by his merry associates, Mustard George.
This original genius was the son of the steward of a certain wealthy landholder,
and resided with his father in a provincial town, where <em>nothing</em> was less known
than <em>everything</em> pertaining to the arts. He was, as his neighbours said, a "<em>nateral
geni</em>;" for he drew all the comical <em>gaffers</em> and <em>gammers</em> of the country round;
and having, to use his own words, "<em>taken off</em> the bench of justices, wigs and all,
<em>shown up</em> the mayor and corporation, <em>dumb-foundered</em> the parson of the parish,
silenced the clerk, and made the sexton laugh at his own <em>grave</em> occupation," he
thought it expedient to beat up for new game in the metropolitan city.</p>

<p>'"A caricaturist in a country town," said George, "like a mad bull in a china-shop,
cannot step without noise; so, having made a little noise in my native
place, I persuaded my father to let me seek my fortune in town."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_81" id="Page_i_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>'It appears that the caricaturist came not to London, like many another wit,
pennyless; his father allowed him an annuity of first fifty, and augmented the sum
to a hundred pounds. With this income, and what he obtained by working for
the publishers, he was enabled to enjoy life in his own way; and might be <em>met</em>, with
a tankard of Burton ale before him, seated behind his pipe, nightly at Offley's;
or, if not there, smoking the fragrant weed, at the <em>Cider Cellar</em>, the <em>Blue Posts</em>,
or <em>The Hole in the Wall</em>. Latterly, his rendezvous was transferred to <em>The
Brown Bear</em> at Bow Street, where he studied those peculiar species of low
characters, the inhabitants of the round-house, and the myrmidons of the police.
Enamoured with the society of these able physiognomists, he ultimately took up
his quarters at the <em>Brown Bear</em>, and there, to the lively grief of these tenderhearted
associates, one night died in character, suddenly, with a glass of brandy
in his hand.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 121px;">
<img src="images/i_100.png" width="121" height="195" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'The wit and invention of this artist places him above all others in the personification
of low scenes of humour. Among his earliest productions were
those series of groups entitled <cite>Effects of Flattery</cite>, <cite>Effects of Hope, &amp;c.</cite>, which
were illustrated by scenes of truly dramatic excellence, and upon
which might well be built farces for the stage which could not fail
to delight the town. His <cite>Babes in the Wood</cite>, <cite>Raffling for a Coffin</cite>,
<cite>The Club of Quidnuncs</cite>, as pieces of original humour, have never,
perhaps, been equalled. Had this low humourist studied drawing
and been temperate in his habits, such was the fecundity of his
imagination and perception of character, that he might have
rivalled even Hogarth. His style, always sufficiently careless,
latterly even outraged the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">outr&eacute;</i>. Yet there were those, and men of taste too,
who insisted that the humour of his pieces was augmented by the extravagance
of this defect.'</p>

<p>The name of Henry Wigstead will be met with pretty constantly in the
course of this volume; his designs approach the nearest to those of Rowlandson
as far as regards humorous qualities, a cultivated sense of beauty
and grace, and a decided grasp of character, without that violent divergence
from the semblance of humanity as ordinarily recognised, to which failing the
old-fashioned caricaturists were somewhat over-addicted, as we are inclined to
suspect; but, like many worthy amateurs of his period, his own hand lacked
the skill to express all that his eye saw and his taste appreciated. In the
guise of a skilled translator of crude ideas, our Caricaturist, with ready ease,
and that dexterity which was peculiarly his own, came to the rescue most efficiently,
and his etchings and scrapings have preserved many a capital design,
due to the esteemed Wigstead, which otherwise would have been lost; the
sterling excellence to be detected in many of these pictorial scenes and satires,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_82" id="Page_i_82">[82]</a></span>
renders the action meritorious, which has enabled posterity to judge how far
those praises which partial contemporaries lavished upon all these non-professional
humourists, were justified by the actual merits of their subjects. We
have already recounted certain jocose and whimsical traits in the disposition and
career of this genial son of merriment; we have nothing to add but the brief
notice from the obituary of <cite>The Gentleman's Magazine</cite> for October 1800,
which informed many a congenial friend of the loss society had sustained, and
made many a heart feel saddened by the stroke which had fallen on the kindliest
and best of comrades.</p>

<p>'At Margate, where he went for the benefit of his health, Henry Wigstead,
Esq., of Kensington, an active magistrate for the county of Middlesex.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> He
was a man of considerable talent, and contributed to the celebrity of the Brandenburgh
theatre, both by his pen and his pencil. He was a good caricaturist,
which naturally made him more enemies than friends. He was hospitable and
generous to a degree of extravagance. He married the daughter of Mr. Bagnal,
of Gerard Street, with whom he had a good fortune, and by whom he leaves
two children, a son and a daughter.'</p>

<p>Another eminent humourist, in whose praise contemporaries were enthusiastic,
but whose biography no one has taken the pains to collect, was John Nixon, <em>the
facetious Nixon</em>, as he is generally entitled in the memoirs and scribblings of the
period; beyond the kindly appreciative anecdotes of this worthy, set down by
Angelo, barely any record exists. Pleasant John Nixon was an Irish factor, and
resided for many years in Basinghall Street, where, over his dark warehouses,
he and his brother Richard kept 'bachelors' court.' The elder brother, John,
however, was the principal mover in all the convivialities and Bacchanalian
revels celebrated in this old-fashioned dwelling; 'which was not too large for
comfort, and yet sufficiently spacious in the first floor, at least, to spread a table
for twelve. Who that were witty, or highly talented of the days that are gone,
who, loving a social gossip, over a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magnum bonum</i> of capital wine, had not been
invited to his hospitable board?' The Nixons were wealthy, and had the
felicity to be well enabled to enjoy life according to their own liking.</p>

<p>John Nixon, besides possessing a well-deserved reputation for social qualifications
of no ordinary calibre, was a man of taste and talent, and an amateur
performer in various arts, his accomplishments being multifarious.</p>

<p>As a man of business he was highly respected, as a man of pleasure universally
sought, and as generally esteemed. Sedulous in his commercial pursuits,
in the counting-house his maxim was that there is time for all things, and he
found leisure daily, when the ledger was closed, to open his heart to the enjoyments
of friendly intercourse. 'I have no objection to placing my knees under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_83" id="Page_i_83">[83]</a></span>
another man's table,' the social <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">convive</i> would say, 'but I had rather seat him at
my own.'</p>

<p>Nixon was at home at the Beef-steak Club, where he was made honorary
secretary and providore, a well-bestowed distinction, since he was a first-rate
connoisseur of wines, and a capital judge of a rump of beef. 'My lord duke,' he
would say to the noble president, 'he who would invite Jupiter to a feast on a
steak, should select a prime cut of little more than half-an-inch thick, from a
Norfolk-fed Scot,' and this, says Angelo, became statute law in that glorious club.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 209px;">
<img src="images/i_102.png" width="209" height="240" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Among other pursuits for which Nixon obtained notoriety among the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">haut
ton</i>, he was known for his fondness for the stage. An excellent amateur performer,
he shone as one of the stars of the celebrated private theatricals held at
Brandenburgh House, when in the possession of the Margrave and Margravine
of Anspach. It was under the splendid roof of these entertainers, on an occasion
when all the amateurs were celebrating their
host's anniversary, that Nixon was honoured with
his cognomen of 'the well-bred man.' On his
late arrival in a piebald uniform, his blue dress-coat,
with the gold buttons of the Beef-steak Club,
being considerably powdered, the wearer, who
was not in the least disconcerted or embarrassed,
related, on taking his seat at the table, a droll tale
of adventures on the road, to the hearty amusement
of the company, while the servants were
in convulsions of laughter, as Nixon described
how the post-horses were knocked up, and he was
obliged to complete his journey and his engagement in the cart of a baker,
where he got completely dusted with flour; whence the Margravine facetiously
dubbed him the 'well-bread man.'</p>

<p>John Nixon's original talent for the humorous department of the graphic
art was well known; as an honorary exhibitor at the Royal Academy for many
years, his grotesque scenes such as <cite>Bartholomew Fair</cite>, and village fêtes,
abounding with character, diverted the public. Angelo, in recording the comical
celebrity of his friend, mentions, 'Nixon had the reputation of introducing,
through his inventive faculty, that most amusing species of caricature, the
converting spades, hearts, clubs, and diamonds into grotesque figures and
groups, which he designed with a whimsicality of appropriateness, that Gillray,
or even George Cruikshank himself, might have envied.'</p>

<p>The list of amateur artists, who enjoyed Rowlandson's friendship, and whose
designs received the advantages which his assistance was able to lend them, will
not be complete without the name of Collings, well known in the regions of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_84" id="Page_i_84">[84]</a></span>
Covent Garden, and some time editor of the <cite>Public Ledger</cite>, who was a lively
satirist, both with his pencil and his pen. 'When Boswell's <cite>Tour to the Hebrides</cite>
was ushered forth, it was celebrated by as many crackers and squibs as the
<cite>Burning of the Boot</cite> (Lord Bute). Among other assailants, the impenetrable
Bozzy had to expose his front to this lampooner's shafts. A whole series of
designs were published by this witty wag, the heroes of which, or rather the
knight and the esquire of his drama, were Johnson and Boswell. The knight, it
is likely, never saw them; and, as for the squire, his love of notoriety rendered
him, if not vain of, at least not vulnerable to, these successive attacks.
<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>'The Laird of Auchinlek, indeed, had a large collection of these satires upon
"self and company," as he used facetiously to inscribe them, and boasted at the
judge's table that his <cite>History</cite> would be more copiously illustrated than even the
Lord High Chancellor, Clarendon's.'</p>

<p>Caleb Whiteford, another crony of the caricaturist, was an excellent judge of
paintings (especially works by the old masters) and was generally known as a
fervent admirer of George Moreland's pictures; he was the reputed discoverer of
'cross readings,'
<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and a dabbler in verse. It was he who, as everyone will
remember, received such a complimentary notice in the postscript to the mock
epitaphs known as Goldsmith's <cite>Retaliation</cite>, that there were not wanting those who
contributed to the flattery by suspecting that the additional epitaph was due to
Caleb's own pen.</p>

<p>Old Caleb Whiteford, the witty wine-merchant and 'connoisseur in old
masters,' knew everyone of any reputation, and was well-received at the various
hospitable boards to which allusions have been made in the course of these
discursive notes; he was a welcome guest at numerous convivial gatherings of
the artistic and literary coteries of the period, whose jovial meetings and good
cheer have been suffered to pass into oblivion, unrecorded by the scribes who
shared 'the cakes and ale,' in the palmy days of sociable festivities and kindly
familiar intercourse.</p>

<p>'Mr. Ephraim Hardcastle, citizen and drysalter,' as he whimsically elected
to style himself&mdash;in sober fact, W. H. Pyne, the artist to whose literary ventures
we have already referred&mdash;has on occasions come to the rescue in his <cite>Wine and

Walnuts, or after-dinner Chit-Chat</cite>. Here is the report of a conversation concerning
Rowlandson, which is supposed to have taken place between Whiteford
and the caricaturist's jolly friend Mitchell, culled from the <cite>Chit-Chat</cite> in question,
which was published in 1823.</p>

<p>'Well, Master Caleb Whiteford
<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
was on his way up the hill in the Adelphi to
his post at the Society of Arts, and who should he stumble upon at the corner of
James Street, just turning round from Rowlandson's, but Master Mitchell, the
quondam banker of old Hodsoll's house. He had, as usual, been foraging among
the multitudinous sketches of that original artist, and held a portfolio under his
arm, and as he was preparing to step into his chariot, Caleb accosted him: "Well,
worthy sir; what! more choice bits&mdash;more graphic whimsies to add to the collection
at Enfield, eh? Well, how fares it with our friend Roly?" (a familiar
term by which the artist was known to his ancient cronies).</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 208px;">
<img src="images/i_104.png" width="208" height="119" alt="" />
</div>

<p>'"Why, yes, Master Caleb Whiteford, I go collecting on, though I begin to
think I have enough already, for I have some hundreds of his spirited works;
but somehow there is a sort of fascination in these matters, and&mdash;heigh&mdash;ha&mdash;ho&mdash;hoo!"
(gaping) "I never go up&mdash;up&mdash;bless the man, why will he live so high?
It kills me to climb his stairs"&mdash;holding his ponderous
sides&mdash;"I never go up, Mister Caleb, but
I find something new, and am tempted to pull my
purse-strings. His invention, his humour, his&mdash;his
oddity is exhaustless." "Yes," said Whiteford,
"Master Roly is never at a loss for a subject,
and I should not be surprised if he is taking a bird's-eye view of you and
me at this moment, and marking us down for game. But it is not his drawings
alone; why, he says he has etched as much copper as would sheathe a first-rate
man-of-war; and I should think he is not far from the mark in his assertion.'</p>

<p>'"Yes," replied the banker, "he ought to be rich, for his genius is certainly
the most exhaustless, the most&mdash;the most&mdash;no, Mister Caleb, there is no end
to him; he manufactures his humorous ware with such increasing vigour, that
I know not what to compare his prolific fancy to, unless it be to the increasing
population....</p>

<p>'"Roly has promised to come down. I would have taken the rogue with
me, only that he is about some new scheme for his old friend Ackermann,
there, and he says he must complete it within an hour. You know Roly's
expedition."'</p>

<p>James Heath, also a caricaturist, and a delineator of sporting sketches, was
another of Rowlandson's intimates; a Good-Friday jaunt, or an Easter excursion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_86" id="Page_i_86">[86]</a></span>
was for many years indulged by these worthies, who with genial Bannister, the
comedian, and their faithful chronicler, Henry Angelo, the fencing-master,
annually kept up the practice of proceeding on a jovial expedition at this season,
some distance from town, Staines, Windsor, or some similar starting-point, being
the rendezvous selected by these congenial spirits.</p>

<p>The list of Rowlandson's friends would be incomplete without the name of
George Moreland, who, with all his eccentricities and shortcomings, was another
favoured child of fortune, whose inheritance was natural genius; and though the
fairy gift was turned to the very worst account, dragged through the mire of
dissipation, and sordidly made to supply the means of that social degradation,
which lowered the possessor beneath his worst associates, the power remained in
the poor shattered wreck, and did not forsake him until, in a state of premature
decay, he perished miserably before his easel.</p>

<p>A sketch of Moreland's career is by no means called for in this place. His
erratic disposition was not without its whimsical traits; sufficient anecdotes exist
of the wayward painter to prove that, beyond his happy qualifications for his
art, there was found in his composition a spice of pleasantry that did not always
degenerate into buffoonery or horse-play, with occasional flashes of wit and
sprightly allusions which, to say the least of them, were remarkably apposite.
Perhaps too much stress has been laid upon Moreland's deficiencies, while his
more agreeable traits have been somewhat slighted. Putting aside the numerous
anecdotal sketches of the painter, we have only to record, in this place at least,
that a friendship existed between the subject of this volume and the man to
whose sketches those of our caricaturist frequently offer a suggestive resemblance,
it being actually difficult to distinguish between the unsigned etchings
and drawings of the two artists, in the walk practised by Moreland. The
similarity of their talent is more evident perhaps in the larger hunting scenes,
and the studies of female heads, tinted in colours, than in any other direction;
although, with the pencil or the chalk, their rustic landscapes, from the freedom
of their respective handlings, are remarkably alike, both in the choice of
subjects and the spirit of the execution.</p>

<p>As we have already noticed, the most characteristic portrait of Moreland, and
the one which appears to offer us the most life-like representation of the capricious
painter, is due to the skill of Rowlandson. We are informed, in a note
which we gather from Angelo, that Moreland, in his various flittings round
the metropolis in dread of creditors, when he took sanctuary with any intimate
whose residence he happened to remember, gave his colleague the caricaturist
the opportunity of exhibiting his friendship by harbouring him in his lodgings
under one of these emergencies, which were of tolerably frequent occurrence.
'Rowlandson, the artist, lodged at Mrs. Lay's printshop, a few doors from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_87" id="Page_i_87">[87]</a></span>
Carlton House, Pall Mall. One morning when I called upon him, we heard a
loud knock at the street door, and looking out of the window, he said, "There's
Colonel Thornton&mdash;&mdash;knock again! He may be at this fun three months
longer; he is come for his picture, but Moreland, having touched fifty pounds in
advance, is never at home to him now. He's in the next room, which he has for
painting. You had better go and do the same with him, and drink gin and
water; he'll like your company, and make you a drawing for nothing." This
was in the middle of the day.'</p>

<p>We are inclined to think that the most memorable of the caricaturist's
associates was James Gillray, whose age was within a year of that of Rowlandson;
it is a coincidence that two unrivalled geniuses, and in such eccentric
walks, should have been both contemporaries, and steady-going friends, never
clashing in the course of their respective careers. In this work various allusions
will be noticed to the intimacy which subsisted between these remarkably gifted
men, each perfectly original in his fashion, and both possessing singular points of
resemblance in their characters.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 197px;">
<img src="images/i_106.png" width="197" height="133" alt="" />
</div>

<p>We content ourselves with mentioning that they occasionally entered into
friendly alliances, but that, when pitted against each
other, they had more regard for friendship than for
party warfare, which they utterly despised, except as
an opening for the exercise of their skill.</p>

<p>Gillray and Rowlandson were, perhaps, never properly
appreciated in their generation, the higher capacities
which distinguished both these spoiled pets and wilful sons of Momus,
were comparatively slighted, if not completely ignored; all that was vulgar, wayward,
and wild in their dispositions was fostered and enlarged upon; their
errors, and their occasional lapses into downright coarseness, were, according to
the lights of the day, flattered and encouraged as flights of the raciest humour;
the crude, careless, and commonplace, received too frequently a hearty and
undeserved recognition, which their ambitious efforts failed to inspire; the very
productions they scorned were exalted, while, when they felt the magic fire
warming their imaginations, the results were misunderstood too commonly.</p>

<p>Their keen intellects, and their satiric sense of the almost constant unfitness
of things as they found them, the gnawing of the vanity of vanities, ever present,
must have made their temperaments peculiarly sensitive to such slights as the
want of discrimination in their admirers which occasionally shocked and continually
disheartened them&mdash;evils which the want of culture, or consideration on
the part of their audience, continually brought in their train.</p>

<p>It is no matter of surprise that the enchantments which they saw before them
at the opening of their careers, vanished all too soon, and left them chilled, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_88" id="Page_i_88">[88]</a></span>
inclined to become misanthropes; the very genius, which promised to be a delight
to themselves and to mankind, proving a bitter curse.</p>

<p>When the satirists, who felt alike and were sympathetic on most points, met,
it seems their intercourse was the reverse of boisterous&mdash;in fact, they were rather
inclined to be depressed, or, at least, they shrunk within themselves with a more
marked contrast to the conduct which should, it was supposed, distinguish
notorious pictorial humourists, and became, perhaps, a trifle more retired and
undemonstrative than ordinary&mdash;possibly to the disappointment of the less-informed
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">habitu&eacute;s</i>, who evidently thought they were defrauded of a diversion, and
had a right to anticipate, these gentlemen being in a sort graphic jesters by profession,
that in private life they would feel themselves impelled to play off a little
whimsical jugglery for the entertainment of the company. These professional
tricks belonged to the lesser lights, and we warrant that Woodward, Collings,
Newton, and the smaller following of the eccentric art, were infinitely more
amusing to the taste of their auditors.</p>

<p>It is certain Gillray was grave and self-contained, and Rowlandson, in his
degree, participated in his friend's humour, slightly at first, perhaps, as a passing
depression, and, later in life, with an intensified and growing grimness, and a
gathering gloom, as friends dropped off, and age crept on, and the caricaturist's
world was materially altered for him, as his work seemed over.</p>

<p>'For years Gillray occasionally smoked his pipe at <cite>The Bell</cite>, <cite>The Coal-Hole</cite>,
or <cite>The Coach and Horses</cite>; and, although the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">convives</i>, whom he met at such dingy
rendezvous, knew that he was that Gillray who fabricated those comical cuts, the
very moral of Farmer George and Boneyparty, of Billy Pitt and Black Charley,
he never sought, like that low coxcomb Moreland, to become king of the company.
He neither exacted, nor were they inclined to pay him, any particular homage.
In truth, with his associates, neighbouring shopkeepers and master manufacturers,
he passed for no greater wit than his neighbours. Rowlandson, his ingenious
compeer, and he, sometimes met. They would, perhaps, exchange half-a-dozen
questions and answers upon the affairs of copper and aquafortis; swear
all the world was one vast masquerade, and then enter into the common chat of
the room, smoke their cigars, drink their punch, and sometimes early, sometimes
late, shake hands at the door, look up at the stars, say "It is a frosty night," and
depart, one for the Adelphi, the other to St. James's Street, each to his bachelor's
bed.'<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Our friend Angelo, a bright chirpy spirit, who retained his liveliness unimpaired,
let us hope, to the last of his long days, not having any pretensions to
be a genius, was exempt from the sinister tendencies which too frequently attend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_89" id="Page_i_89">[89]</a></span>
its possession. Although, as he confesses in his <cite>Memoirs</cite>, not precisely the 'rose'
himself, he had lived near it, and his association with men of an admittedly
high type, as far as gifts of fancy and versatile talents were concerned, had taught
him to observe the drawbacks not unusually allied to distinguishing attainments;
and he records a few sober axioms for the enlightenment of those who have been
excluded from his privileges.</p>

<p>'Those who at a distance contemplate characters like these, so professedly
eminent for invention, wit, and satirical humour, naturally suppose their society
must be universally sought; and that such must, of necessity, be the life and soul
of the convivial board. Men, however, who see much and speculate but little,
know better. Among the dullest in company could be pointed out those who
are "wondrous witty" by themselves; and this not from pride of their superior
faculty to please, but from a constitutional shyness or modest desire to avoid
notice or applause&mdash;or from indolence, or actually from conscious dulness when
absent from the study and the desk, when without the pencil and the pen.</p>

<p>'Peter Pindar was witless, even over his bottle, with his most intimate
cronies. Anthony Pasquin was sour, and not prone to converse. Churchill was
a sulky sot. Butler was lively neither drunk nor sober&mdash;a choice companion
only when "half gone;" hence, as the witty Duke of Buckingham observed,
"he was to be compared to a skittle, little at both ends, but great in the middle!"
Burton, who had no less humour than Cervantes, and the learning of a whole
university to boot, was neither a cheerful companion, nor endurable to himself.
A hundred more could be named, whose aptitude and promptness to discover
the ridiculous side of human action, has astonished the grave; and yet, these
men who have thus exposed folly to the laughter of mankind, have been themselves
the dullest dogs alive. Gillray was always "hipped," and at last sunk
into that deplorable state of mental aberration which verifies the couplet, so often
quoted, wherein the consanguinity of wit to madness is so eminently proved, to
the comfort of those who thank God for their own stupidity.'</p>

<p>Perhaps the most constant friend, and certainly the best adviser, our caricaturist
retained to the grave was his principal publisher, Mr. Rudolph Ackermann.
We have mentioned this gentleman last among the personal associates of Rowlandson,
as his untiring services only ended with the life of the artist.</p>

<p>The name of Rudolph Ackermann, who died March 30, 1834, is worthy of
more than a passing mention; he has been cited as one of the first natives of
Germany who, by far-sighted and active occupation, accompanied by philanthropic
exertions for the benefit of his fellow-creatures, raised the character of his nationality
to a high point of esteem in other countries. An account of his energetic
and charitable career appeared in the <cite>Didaskalia</cite>, Frankfurt-am-Main, No. 103,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_90" id="Page_i_90">[90]</a></span>
April 13, 1864, and was adopted by the writer (W. P.) of an excellent notice upon
the well-known publisher, in the pages of <cite>Notes and Queries</cite>, (4th S. iv., August
7 and 14, 1869). The son of a coach-builder, Rudolph Ackermann was born
April 20, 1764, at Stolberg, in the Saxon Hartz. We are told 'his sympathies
with the misfortunes of others were so warmly excited by the misery seen around
him in the famine of 1772&ndash;73, that he frequently in later years excused the zeal
which he showed on other occasions, by pictures of the distress that he experienced
when he, at the age of eight years, was employed for hours daily
in distributing food and money.' In 1775 his father removed to Schneeberg.
Rudolph received his education in the local school till he was fifteen years old,
and showed a decided predilection for literary pursuits; but his father's pecuniary
position precluding the choice of a profession to more than one of his sons, he
entered the paternal factory. An elder brother, Frederick, instructed Rudolph
in the use of the drawing instruments, and he busied himself more willingly in
the offices than in the workshops, gaining an acquaintance with details, which
proved subsequently as important to his advancement as were his visits to Dresden,
the towns of the Rhine, and Hueningen near Basle. He afterwards went
to reside in Paris, where he became the friend of Carrossi, the most esteemed designer
of equipages of his time, and Rudolph, who proved his best pupil, acquired
sufficient knowledge as a practical draughtsman to push his way in the world.
From Paris he proceeded to London in pursuit of fortune, and to turn his talents
to account: he was delighted to find that, in the metropolis, carriage-building
was one of the most successful occupations, and that the exercise of his acquirements
would be handsomely rewarded; so for several years, until 1795, he was
employed in furnishing the principal coachmakers with designs and models for
new and improved carriages. The models of the state coach, built at the cost of
nearly 7,000<i>l.</i>, for the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland in 1790,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and that for the Lord
Mayor of Dublin in 1791, exhibited his taste and skill. In 1805, the preparation
of the car that served as a hearse at the funeral of Lord Nelson was entrusted
to him; and during the years 1818&ndash;20 the patent for a moveable axle for
carriages engaged much of his attention.</p>

<p>It is not, however, in this connection that we have to consider Ackermann,
but rather in his relation to the arts as a print-seller and publisher. On his marriage
with an English lady, with commendable prudence, he became desirous of
establishing a business which would, in case of his own premature decease, prove
a suitable provision for his family. He commenced the print trade at 96 Strand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_91" id="Page_i_91">[91]</a></span>
and soon after he secured a large apartment, 65 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 24
feet high, at 101 Strand (erected upon the courtyard of Beaufort House), which
had been the drawing academy of William Shipley; it had then passed to Henry
Pars, and later passed into the hands of the Radicals, and became notorious as
the British Forum, when it was used by John Thelwall for his oratorical lectures.
These meetings exceeding the bounds of reasonable political discussion, the
Government instituted prosecutions, and the Forum ceased to exist. On the
ministerial interference, October 1794, Mr. Ackermann was enabled to secure
the lease of the premises, and the room was again used as a school for drawing.
In 1796 the entire business was removed to 101 Strand. The drawing academy
seems to have flourished; and in 1806 there were three masters engaged for
figures, landscape, and architecture, and some eighty pupils were resorting to the
school, when the requirements of the founder's business, as a publisher, printseller,
and dealer in fancy articles, papers, medallions, and artist's materials, had
so increased, that the convenience of this room as a warehouse became of more
consideration than the continuance of the school.</p>

<p>During the revolutionary era, and when French emigrants were numerous in
this country, Mr. Ackermann was one of the first to find a liberal employment
for the refugees; it is said that he had seldom less than fifty nobles, priests, and
ladies engaged upon screens, card-racks, flower-stands, and other ornamental
work.</p>

<p>His inventive faculties and his disposition to take up with new ideas were
marked by many improvements he introduced. At the beginning of the century
he was one of the first who arrived at a method of waterproofing paper, leather,
woollen stuffs, and felted fabrics, in which he obtained for some time considerable
traffic; this branch was conducted in a factory he established at Chelsea for the
purpose.</p>

<p>He further contrived an apparatus which was at least ingenious, both in theory
and intention. To counteract Napoleon's endeavours, by bridling the newspapers,
to keep the French nation in complete ignorance, as was actually the
case, of events that were disastrous to him, Mr. Ackermann bethought himself
of reviving, for the annoyance of the enemy, the use made by the French in
1794&ndash;96 of aërostation in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'Entreprenant</i> and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">T&eacute;l&eacute;maque</i>; and he contrived
a simple mechanism which would, every minute, detach thirty printed placards
from a packet of three thousand. Three such parcels were attached to balloons
thirty-six inches in diameter, made of gold-beater's skin, and committed to the
air in the summer of 1807. The success of the experiment was proved at
Woolwich in the presence of a Government commission. With a southerly wind
the balloons passed over Salisbury and Exeter, and several of the placards, as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_92" id="Page_i_92">[92]</a></span>
proof of the practical working of the machinery, were returned to London from
various parts of the country.</p>

<p>Mr. Ackermann was one of the first inhabitants of London who adopted the
use of gas as a means of artificial light to his premises.</p>

<p>The establishment of lithography in England was another example of his
patient and persevering expenditure of money and time in the introduction and
improvement of a novelty. 'He was not content with translating Alois Senefelder's
treatise in 1819, but made a journey to the residence of that inventor,
in order to exchange the results of their theory and practice before producing in
1822 a <cite>Complete Course</cite>. The business relations between leading artists and
Mr. Ackermann enabled him to induce them to touch the lithographic chalk; so
in 1817, through Prout and others, the process became an acceptable, or rather
a fashionable mode of multiplying drawings; lithography, for want of such
advantages, when introduced into this country by Mr. Andr&eacute;c, of Offenbach, in its
original and rude state, had failed to make its way, and all its subsequent success
may be attributed to Mr. Ackermann's personal emulation of the advancement it
made in Munich.'</p>

<p>In 1813, upon receiving an authentic account from Count Schönfeld of the
misery produced in Germany by Napoleon's wars, particularly in Saxony, culminating
in engagements at Leipzig (during the 'five days' October 15&ndash;19,
1813), 'Mr. Ackermann temporarily abandoned the oversight of his own multifarious
occupations, in order to exert all his strength in procuring aid for the
sufferers. With the help of the Duke of Sussex, he formed a committee in
Westminster and in the City; the first obtained a Parliamentary grant of
100,000<i>l.</i>, and the second furnished a larger sum in private contributions. This
was the occasion on which the use of Whitehall Chapel was granted for a
musical performance in aid of the subscription. For two years, Mr. Ackermann
undertook the task of corresponding with the German committees for distributing
these sums, examining into the urgency of the appeals for help, and apportioning
the fund. The members of "The Westminster Association for the further
relief of the sufferers by the war in Germany," were anxious to commemorate
their sense of the pains, prudence, and probity Mr. Ackermann had displayed,
by presenting him with a testimonial in silver; this costly acknowledgment,
together with a vote of thanks proposed to be inscribed on
parchment in gold, he had the modesty to decline, begging that all thanks
for his services might be comprised in a few autograph lines from the Archbishop
of Canterbury.'</p>

<p>In his business relations we are told, 'the discretion which he exercised
in choosing his subordinates, and the liberal manner in which he repaid their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_93" id="Page_i_93">[93]</a></span>
services, enabled him to produce several books which deserve the notice of all
those who know how to appreciate the merit of these illustrated works in colour,
relatively to others of similar pretension, both of that time and of the present day.</p>

<p>'A long list might be formed by enumerating the literary, musical, and
scientific men of more or less eminence, who appeared as his coadjutors, and
who enjoyed his intimacy. Several of them owed to him a helping hand, either
in their first efforts or in their declining fortunes. To the end of his days he
retained a strongly-marked German pronunciation of the English language,
which gave additional flavour to the banters and jests uttered in his fine bass
voice; but he wrote in English with great purity on matters of affection and
business long before middle life.</p>

<p>'From early in 1813, every Wednesday evening in March and April was
given to a reception, half a conversazione and half a family party, in his large
room, which then, as at other times, served as an exhibition of English and
foreign books, maps, prints, woodcuts, lithographs, drawings, paintings, and other
works of art and ornament, besides the leading Continental periodicals. There
on those evenings, by annual invitation,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> amateurs, artists, and authors were sure
to find people whom they knew, or wanted to know. Many an introduction grew
to an acquaintance; and the value of such evenings to foreigners was often
gratefully acknowledged by travellers, who, with any distinction in art or literature,
were welcome without any other introduction.</p>

<p>'His active assiduity and his spirited enterprise were suspended by a weakness
of sight, commencing from his charitable exertions in 1814, which made
his repose at Camberwell, and afterwards at Ivy Lodge in the Fulham Road,
first a matter of prudence, and later on of necessity. In the spring of 1830
he experienced an attack of paralysis, and never recovered sufficiently to exert
his intelligence in business. He removed for a change of air to Finchley, but
a second stroke produced a gradual decline of strength in the honourable old
man; and March 30, 1834, saw an end put to the hearty kindness, constant
hospitality, and warm beneficence which had been inseparable from his unquestioned
integrity. He was interred on April 9 in the family grave, in the
burial-ground of St. Clement Danes.'<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 75px;"><img src="images/tb.jpg" alt="* * * * *" /></div>

<p>The little that remains to be recorded of the Caricaturist is best expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_94" id="Page_i_94">[94]</a></span>
by the kindly writer, a friend of nearly half a century's standing, who
contributed an obituary notice of the artist to the <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite>
(June 1827).</p>

<p>It is not generally known that, although a considerable proportion of Rowlandson's
humorous political and social etchings are in many instances strongly
tinctured by an absence of refinement in taste, and are roughly executed&mdash;the
means simply of tiding over some pressing necessity, or providing funds for further
relaxations&mdash;his early works were characterised by painstaking and conscientious
application; and his studies from the human figure at the Royal Academy
were scarcely inferior to the productions of Mortimer, then the most admired
and proficient among the Academic professors.</p>

<p>From the versatility of his talent, the fecundity of his imagination, his command
of composition, in which he equalled the greatest masters, the grace and
elegance with which he could design his groups, added to the almost miraculous
despatch with which he supplied his patrons with perfectly original compositions
upon every subject, it was a theme of regret at his decease, that he had not
sufficiently valued his reputation, to which it has been suspected he was
thoroughly indifferent. It was universally admitted in his own days that, had
he pursued the course of art steadily, he might have become one of the foremost
and most celebrated historical painters of the English school. His style, which
was purely his own, was unquestionably original. His bold, fluent, and spiritedly
turned outlines were thrown off with easy dexterity, with his famous reed-pen,
in a tint composed of vermilion and Indian-ink, the general effect was rapidly
washed in, so as to produce an effective <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiaro-oscuro</i>, and the whole was coloured
in tender tints with a most harmonious arrangement of colour.</p>

<p>His manner, though slight in almost every instance, is highly effective; and
it is known on indubitable authority that the presidents of the Royal Academy,
Sir Joshua Reynolds and Sir Benjamin West, whose manners were most foreign
to those of the Caricaturist, individually asserted their conviction that many of
his drawings would have done honour to Rubens, or to the most esteemed
masters of design of the old schools.</p>

<p>For many years he was too indolent to seek new employment, and his kind
friend, and it may be added with justice, his best adviser, Mr. Ackermann, the
respected and leading publisher of Rowlandson's period, supplied him with
ample subjects for the exercise of his talent. The many works which his pencil
illustrated are existing evidence of this, and books containing impressions from
Rowlandson's etchings continue to fetch high prices, and are industriously sought
after. Many suggestions for plates to enliven new editions of <cite>The Travels of
Dr. Syntax</cite>, <cite>The Dance of Death</cite>, <cite>The Dance of Life</cite>, and other well-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_95" id="Page_i_95">[95]</a></span>
productions of the pen of the prolific Coombe, the Defoe of the eighteenth
century, will remain esteemed and lasting mementoes of his graphic humour.</p>

<p>It should be repeated that his reputation had never reached its full
maturity in the life-time of Mr. Ackermann, his friend, patron, and publisher.
The inimitable water-colour drawings of Rowlandson, of which he had a large
collection, were justly appreciated by connoisseurs, and his folios have often been
viewed with admiration and delight by the many professional artists and amateurs
who frequented Mr. Ackermann's conversazioni at his library at the old house
in the Strand. No artist of the past or present school, perhaps, ever expressed
so much as Rowlandson, with so little effort, or with so evident an appearance of
the absence of labour.</p>

<p>The artist's remains were followed to the grave by the two friends of his
youth, John Bannister and Henry Angelo, and his constant friend and liberal

Street.&mdash;This print appears to have been about the earliest recognised specimen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_97" id="Page_i_97">[97]</a></span>
of Rowlandson's handiwork. The plate has a wash of aquatint, all over it, and
the etching is free and bold. As an early work it evinces certain carefulness and
discrimination, which promised well for the artist's future if he persevered in
the same direction. The suggestion of the subject, according to the initials, is
due to Henry Wigstead, whose name appears on numerous fine examples of
Rowlandson's skill. The village practitioner, outside whose cottage is the sign
of a gilt pestle, has evidently been disturbed under false pretences on previous
occasions, and now a real client has knocked him up, for the benefit of his professional
services, his indignation is bursting forth on the wrong object.</p>

<p>The scene of this animated dispute is the Library at the house lately inhabited
by the departed Thrale. Mrs. Piozzi (late Mrs. Thrale) and Boswell are in
high dudgeon over their respective memoirs of their idol, the defunct Doctor
Johnson. In both of their 'Lives' the trifling weaknesses of the great Lexicographer
are made ridiculous, under the misguiding impulse of the 'anecdotic itch.'
The rival biographers are bouncing and stamping about the study, in a fine rage,
ready to pull one another to pieces. The learned lady's second husband, the
stout musician, Piozzi, with his violoncello by his side, is seated in an easy chair,
regarding the disputants with consternation, while deprecating violence.</p>

<p>A stout knight (possibly a lineal descendant of Sir John Falstaff) is the
<em>Pleader</em>; he is lounging on an elegant sofa of the early Georgian period, making
inane love to a pretty girl placed by his side, dressed in a picturesque Watteau-like
costume, with a quilted petticoat and a quaint mob-cap added; the amorous
old trifler's hand is on the slim waist of the beauty; the damsel is standing up in
a negligently easy pose, while she is toying with her antiquated admirer and
waving his enormous and elaborately curled double-tailed wig in the air. A dog
is at her side. The drawing of this picture is unusually graceful and easy, even
for Rowlandson; this is most noticeable in respect to the pretty coquette. The
etching is spirited and brilliant, and the background and accessories are delicately
aquatinted, to bear out the resemblance to a sketch in Indian ink.</p>

an indefatigable canvasser on behalf of the 'Friend of the People;' during the
contests for Westminster, Sam kept open house for the friends of the Whig
chief, and entertained all the notabilities of the Whig party. Summer and winter,
Sam dressed in a clean nankeen jacket and breeches, and brightly polished shoes
and buckles; he wore no covering, neither hat nor wig, on a perfectly bald head;
his waistcoat was constantly open in all seasons, and he wore remarkably white
linen; his legs were generally bare, but when covered, it was always in stockings
of the finest silk.</p>

<p>In Rowlandson's spirited portrait old Sam is standing in his sturdy fashion,
clean, shaven, and bright, in his eccentric costume, with his shining round poll,
a pot with his cipher in one hand, and his pipe in the other. In the rear is
shown his public-house, with smokers and customers indicated at the windows.
This portrait, which seems to have been deservedly popular, was published with
variations. In one impression (printed in sepia), is a barrel inscribed '<em>No
Pope</em>,' and in another, '<em>Fox for ever! Huzza!</em>' The second plate is crossed
with very fine stipple, and an old man is introduced in the background with
his hand on his bald head.</p>

<p>The prints are signed with the initials T. R. and J. J., and were published by
Thomas Rowlandson and J. Jones at 103 Wardour Street. Under some impressions
is the inscription, 'The first man who jumped off Westminster Bridge.'</p>

<p>Poor disabled sailors are limping off on their crutches, disgusted with the
results of their sacrifices and the miserable rewards for their services; while a
drummer is drubbing in their favoured and well-requited commanders.
The composition of this subject is particularly good, and it is worthy of
remark that, in the coloured impressions of this print, the tinting is arranged with
considerable success; and although, as is the general practice with caricatures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_101" id="Page_i_101">[101]</a></span>
none but the most vivid colours are employed, the arrangement is so good and
delicate that the general effect is as harmonious and artistic as in the original
drawings by Rowlandson's own hand.</p>

<div class="caption">THE POWER OF REFLECTION.</div>
</div>

<p><i>June 30, 1781.</i> <cite><a href="#THE_POWER">The Power of Reflection</a>.</cite> Published by J. Harris, Sweeting's
Alley, Cornhill.&mdash;This print is executed in mezzotint by J. Jones, whose name
appears several times in connection with that of Rowlandson, on the series of
plates which we shall particularise in the progress of this work. The contrast
is very marked between the Duenna, the lines of whose face have fallen in
under the assaults of time, and the demoiselle, in all the pride of youth and
attractiveness, aided by the bravery of a fashionable and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piquante</i> toilette. <cite>The
Power of Reflection</cite> is probably intended to suggest a pictorial pun. While
the maiden is absorbed in the pleasing reflection of her own figure as thrown
back in the mirror, her senior, with a ponderous and probably serious volume
before her, is employing her thoughts on contemplations of a more philosophical
description.</p>

<p><i>October 28, 1781.</i> <cite><a href="#E_O">E O, or the Fashionable Vowels</a>.</cite>&mdash;It may be noticed,
respecting the earlier works of Rowlandson, that his efforts, soon after he left
the Academy, were marked with more care and elaboration than his later
etchings; while the effects of his training were still fresh in his mind, he
evidently took more pains in the direction of finish, and it is particularly in
his management of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiaro-oscuro</i> that we detect the superiority of the artistic
productions of his first period; although experience alone could give him that
special freedom and facility which render his best-known productions remarkable.</p>

<p>In the early and clear impressions of the <cite>E O Table</cite>, and its surroundings,
the artist's skill is even more conspicuous than usual in the spirited grouping;
the attitudes and expressions of the several gamblers are distinct with individuality
and strongly-marked traits of character. Every variety of emotion&mdash;cunning,
credulity, confidence, anxiety, stolid indifference, scheming, craft, stupidity,
hectoring, exaltation, and despair&mdash;we find pictured with an ability which surprises
us, contrasting as it does with the indifferent caricatures and the dearth of
humorous talent in the years which intervened between the death of Hogarth
and the appearance of the more ambitious subjects by Gillray and Rowlandson,
works executed while the talents of these masters were at their best, and before
they had grown careless of their reputation.</p>

<p>The <cite>E O Table</cite><a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
 was republished at various dates: in January 1786 it re-appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_102" id="Page_i_102">[102]</a></span>
with a new title, as <cite>Private Amusement</cite>, and from time to time it was
reissued, the date of publication being altered to suit the several occasions.</p>

luck. They were open to everybody, till at last the Bow Street police began to
interfere.'</p>

<p>An attempt was made, at the commencement of 1731, to suppress some of the
most considerable gaming-houses in London and the suburbs, particularly one,
behind Gray's Inn Walks. The editor of the <cite>St. James's Evening Post</cite> observed
upon this occasion: 'It may be matter of instruction as well as amusement to
present our readers with the following list of officers which are established in
the most notorious <span class="locked">gaming-houses:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>'A <em>Commissioner</em>, always a proprietor, who looks in of a night; the week's
account is audited by him and two others of the proprietors.</p>

<p>'A <em>Director</em>, who superintends the room.</p>

<p>'Two <em>Puffs</em>, who have money given them to decoy others to play.</p>

<p>'A <em>Clerk</em>, who is a check upon the <em>Puffs</em>, to see that they sink none of the
money given them to play with.</p>

<p>'A <em>Squib</em> is a <em>Puff</em> of a lower rank, who serves at half-salary while he is
learning to deal.</p>

<p>'A <em>Flasher</em>, to swear how often the bank has been stripped.</p>

<p>'A <em>Dunner</em>, who goes about to recover money lost at play.</p>

<p>'A <em>Waiter</em>, to fill out wine, snuff candles, and attend in the gaming-room.</p>

<p>'An <em>Attorney</em>, a Newgate solicitor.</p>

<p>'A <em>Captain</em>, who is to fight any gentleman that is peevish for losing his money.</p>

<p>'An <em>Usher</em>, who lights gentlemen up and down stairs, and gives the word to
the porter.</p>

<p>'A <em>Porter</em>, who is generally a soldier of the Foot Guards.</p>

<p>'An <em>Orderly-man</em>, who walks up and down the outside of the door, to give
notice to the porter and alarm the house at the approach of constables.</p>

<p>'A <em>Runner</em>, who is to get intelligence of the Justices meeting.</p>

<p>'Link-boys, watchmen, chairmen, drawers, or others, who bring the first intelligence
of the Justices' meetings, or of the constables being out&mdash;<em>half-a-guinea</em>

H. Humphrey.&mdash;In this engraving a good deal of Rowlandson's manner is
traceable, and the etching is at least due to his hand. The subject represents a
group of four <em>brothers of the whip</em>, whose persons and features are marked with
that discrimination for character and faculty for grasping individual peculiarities
distinctive of the caricaturist. In the background are figured coach-horses, carriages,
saddle-horses, grooms, &amp;c., all depicted in his own marked style.</p>

<p><i>December 22, 1783.</i> <cite>Great Cry and Little Wool.</cite> Published by Humphrey,
Strand.&mdash;Somewhat in Sayer's style, the principal figures giving indications of
his manner. The personification of Evil, with his horns, hoofs, pointed claws, and
forked tail, has a firm hold of Fox, and is shearing the 'Protector's' chest and
clawing at his profuse locks. The India Bill, under the Evil One's arm, indicates
the source of the satire. The surroundings are more especially in Rowlandson's
free handling; the India House is in the background, and the members of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_110" id="Page_i_110">[110]</a></span>
East India Corporation are performing a gleeful dance around a memorable
pile&mdash;the funeral pyre in effigy of their arch-enemy, treated as a fox roasting on
a gibbet.</p>

<p>1783 (?). <cite>The Times.</cite>&mdash;This caricature represents the situation, from a popular
point of view, at the period of the struggle for the Regency which occurred on
the first illness of the King. According to Rowlandson's print, right is prevailing
and everything is to be settled for the future happiness of the kingdom by the
Prince of Wales's accession to the throne; as will be remembered, it was for a
short period doubtful whether the King's health would ever be sufficiently
restored to enable him to resume the control of the State.</p>

<p>The heir-apparent is shown as the virtuous prince we read of in fairy tales,
endowed with all the graces both of mind and person. The Prince is supported,
at the foot of the throne, by such protection as <em>Liberty</em> and <em>Justice</em> are placing at
his disposal; his foot is on the first step, the <em>Voice of the People</em>; the other steps
are <em>Public Safety</em>, <em>Patriotism</em>, and <em>Virtue</em>; the crown remains suspended over his
head, his right hand is on his heart, and <em>Britannia</em> is leading him to his place,
while she is waving back the party which opposed his assumption of an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad
interim</i> Regency. The symbolical <em>Ruler of the Waves</em> is declaring: 'I have long
been deceived by hypocrisy, but have at last discovered an intention of sacrificing
the rights of my people to satisfy a private ambition.' The Queen and her
German friends, Madame Schwellenberg and others, are represented as disconcerted
Furies, waving hissing snakes, and begirt with <em>Falsehood</em>, <em>Envy</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Queen Charlotte combined with Pitt to oppose, by every stratagem within
their power, the assumption of the Regency by her eldest son. The Queen is
brandishing the torch of <em>Rebellion</em>; Pitt is thrown into despair, and he is 'bidding
a long farewell to all his greatness,' before his retirement from public life, as
reasonably might have been his case, if the Prince's party had come into power.
<em>Commerce</em>, allegorically represented as a fair female, is applauding the elevation
of the Prince to the vacant throne, and a deputation from the Corporation of the

POLITICAL CARICATURES.</h2>


<p>A few examples of the caricatures published by Rowlandson during the
famous contested election for Westminster in 1784 were included by the present
writer in his account of the works of <em>James Gillray the Caricaturist</em>, as certain
prints issued on this occasion were doubtless due to a combination on the part
of the two caricaturists; however, those plates which bear special indications of
Rowlandson's style were set down to their proper author.</p>

<p><i>January 1, 1784.</i> <cite>The Pit of Acheron, or the Birth of the Plagues of
England.</cite>&mdash;This plate bears the initials <em>F. N.</em>, 1784, in the right-hand corner,
but there is no doubt, judging from the evidence of the style of execution, that
the chief merit is due to Rowlandson. During the progress of the struggle, in
1784, plates innumerable were published anonymously, or with varying initials.
Collectors who have devoted time and observation to the subject, and such well-qualified
writers as the compiler of <cite>The History of Caricature and Grotesque in
Art, The Caricature History of the Georges, &amp;c.</cite>, seem agreed upon the proportion
of prints which are due to the skill of our artist, whose handiwork is very
prominent amongst the series of electioneering and political satires which appeared
on the occasion of Fox's renowned campaign at the Westminster hustings,
when the <em>Champion of the People</em> contended successfully against the second
Ministerial candidate, Sir Cecil Wray, although the latter received all the assistance
which Pitt, with the influence of the King as well, unscrupulously exercised
as it was, could bring into play, legitimately or otherwise, to defeat the popular
Whig chief, and to inflict the mortification of a lost election upon 'the party'
and on their leader, who was at that time the pet aversion of George the Third
and idol of the people.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Rowlandson was by no means a party satirist;
unlike Sayer, who was notoriously in the Ministerial pay, he lavished his satire
on both sides alternately, utterly regardless of partisanship, and, often at the expense
of consistency, we find his cartoons alternately espousing and ridiculing
the same section, Whig or Tory, Ministerialist or Opposition, in plates of whimsically
opposite tendencies, which not infrequently bear the same date.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_112" id="Page_i_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p><cite>The Pit of Acheron</cite>, if we may trust the satirist, is not situated at any considerable
distance from Westminster; the precincts of that city appear through
the smoke of the incantations which are carried on in the Pit. Three weird
sisters, like the Witches in 'Macbeth,' are working the famous charm; a monstrous
cauldron is supported by death's-heads and harpies; the ingredients of the broth
are various; a crucifix, a rosary, <em>Deceit</em>, <em>Loans</em>, <em>Lotteries</em>, and <em>Pride</em>, together with
a fox's head, cards, dice, daggers, and an executioner's axe, &amp;c., form portions of
the accessories employed in these uncanny rites. Three heads are rising from
the flames&mdash;the good-natured face of Lord North, the spectacled and incisive
outline of Burke, and Fox's 'gunpowder jowl,' which is drifting Westminster-wards.
One hag, who is dropping <em>Rebellion</em> into the brew, is demanding,
'Well, sister, what hast thou got for the ingredients of our charm'd pot?' To
this her fellow-witch, who is turning out certain mischievous ingredients which
she has collected in her bag, is responding, 'A beast from Scotland called an
Erskine, famous for duplicity, low art, and cunning; the other a monster who'd
spurn even at Charter's Rights.' Erskine is shot out of the bag, crying, 'I am
like a Proteus, can turn to any shape, from a sailor to a lawyer, and always lean
to the strongest side!' The other member, whose tail is that of a serpent, is
singing, 'Over the water and over the lee, thro' hell I would follow my Charlie.'</p>

<p><i>January 4, 1784.</i> <cite>The Fall of Dagon, or Rare News for Leadenhall Street.</cite>
Published by William Humphrey, 227 Strand.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
And behold Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the Lord,
and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the
threshold.</div>

<p>The image of Dagon, which in this case is borrowed to typify the Coalition
Ministers, has fallen from the overset <em>Broad Bottom</em> pedestal, and is in the
posture described by the quotation; its double-faced head wears the profiles of
North and Fox. Tower Hill is represented in the background; a scaffold is
erected, and the public executioner is just bringing down his axe on the neck
of a traitor&mdash;a delicate compliment to the heads of the late Administration. John
Bull has changed the sign of his house to <em>The Axe</em>, and he is composedly
enjoying his pipe under its shadow.</p>

<p><i>January 7, 1784.</i> <cite>The Loves of the Fox and the Badger, or the Coalition
Wedding.</cite> Published by W. Humphrey, 227 Strand.&mdash;Nine small compartments,
very neatly executed upon one plate, are employed to portray the unpopular
Coalition Ministry between Fox and North. (1) <cite>The Fox beats the Badger in the
Bear Garden.</cite> The unwieldy form of the Badger (Lord North) lies, apparently
asleep, on the floor of 'the House;' the Fox, with his brush erect in triumph, is in
command of the situation. (2) The <em>Fox</em> has been throwing dice on Hounslow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_113" id="Page_i_113">[113]</a></span>
Heath, and he has a <em>dream</em>; the vision seems to indicate a choice between a
prison or a traitor's head on a spike. (3) The <em>Badger</em>, with his riband, tucked
up comfortably on a sofa, also indulges in a <em>dream</em>; the objects offered for his
selection are seemingly the gallows or an executioner's block. (4) <em>Satan unites
them</em>; the arch-fiend, in person, is joining their paws and pronouncing the magic
spell, '<em>Necessity</em>.' (5) <em>They quarter their arms.</em> Their new escutcheon is symbolical;
above a scroll marked '<em>Money</em>' the twin supporters are holding up a
well-filled Treasury-bag, borne by John Bull, above whose head flourishes a pair
of donkey's ears. (6) <em>The priest advertises the wedding.</em> The Devil, presiding
at the pay-table, is enlisting the advocacy of the press, and three editors, in return
for substantial considerations, are respectively promising: 'I'll <em>Chronicle</em> the
Coalition,' 'We will <em>Post</em> them,' 'Harry will take both sides.' (7) <em>The Honeymoon
or Eddystone Lighthouse</em>; the pair are making up a flaming beacon. (8) <em>The
New Orator Henley, or the Churching.</em> The happy pair are now in their glory,
seated on a throne in the '<em>Bear Garden</em>,' and surrounded at a respectful distance
by the heads (stuck on poles) of the members of their new Parliament, and
described as a '<em>Mopstick majority</em>.' The churching is proceeding; the
original pastor is still present, and is prompting Orator Henley, whose tub
stands on a block, labelled, '<em>Honest Jack Lee</em>;' the Orator is holding forth a
parchment, and declaring, 'A charter is nothing but a piece of parchment with a
great seal dangling to it;' to which pious deduction his clerk mounted on 'A Seat
for Portsmouth,' is crying, '<em>Necessity</em>. <em>Amen.</em>' (9) <em>The Wedding Dance and Song.</em>
The pair, now led by the nose by their Satanic friend, are perforce compelled
to execute a pretty lively dance, as their conductor wills. They are singing this
appropriate <span class="locked"><em>epithalamium</em>:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>It seemed, at the beginning of 1784, as if Fox were completely master of the
political situation, and indeed he approached much nearer to an absolute control of
the Administration than he was ever destined to reach again during the lifetime
of his great opponent. The bold man&oelig;uvres of Pitt, backed by the royal favour&mdash;the
King and his friends condescending to dissimulation and subterfuge where
honest policy would not suffice their turn&mdash;were crowned with unexpected success,
and the Cromwell of the hour fell suddenly from his influential eminence.
Up to the famous Westminster Election, Fox was paramount, both in Parliament
and out of doors; for although Pitt was actually Crown-Minister, both he and his
party were almost powerless when arrayed against the members of the ex-Coalition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_114" id="Page_i_114">[114]</a></span>
Ministry, their opponents, led by Fox, and his strong following, who were
the real masters of the situation; thus we find a very characteristic portrait of
the <cite>Friend of Liberty and of the People</cite> introduced, with an allusion to Cromwell.</p>

<p><i>January 19, 1784.</i> <cite>His Highness the Protector.</cite>&mdash;The supplies are kept
with a tight hand; and Fox, taking advantage of his power, has put a huge
padlock on the door of the Treasury, the key of which he seems determined to
retain in his own keeping; a small dagger, held in the popular champion's right
hand, indicates that he is prepared to stand on the defensive. His colleague
Lord North, with his star round his neck, appears as a bulldog, who is supporting
his leader in keeping the supplies inviolate.</p>

<p>The apprehensions of the Pittites (whose chances of retaining the reins of
administration in defiance of an Opposition too strong for their policy, now
seemed desperate), pictured forth the total subversion of Throne and State; and it
was under this influence that the King&mdash;whose stubborn will was strengthened
by contradiction&mdash;indulged his threat of retiring to his German possessions, if
he could not secure the return to office of his particular friends, whose hopes of
recovering their lost control of the State were somewhat forlorn previous to the
election; while Fox, on the other hand, was endeavouring to force the King to
accede to the measures he had introduced for the restriction of the royal prerogative.
A very complete, but necessarily over-coloured, view of the anticipations
of 'the party' is thus pictured forth by Rowlandson.</p>

<p><i>January 23, 1784.</i> <cite>The Times, or a View of the Old House in Little
Britain,&mdash;with Nobody going to Hanover.</cite> Published by W. Humphrey, 227
Strand.&mdash;The Old House is seemingly in a bad way; the foundation is <em>Public
Credit</em>; the Funds, represented as a grilled gate, are secured with a huge padlock;
the Royal Crown and Sceptre are placed on a block, and marked <em>for sale</em>;
seated on another block, labelled <em>Protector</em>, sits the fox, guarding the Treasury;
round his waist is a chain secured to the <em>Coalition-pillar</em>, which is depicted as
rather a twisted support. Lord North has perched his unwieldy person upon a
turnstile, and is crying, indifferent to consequences, 'Give me my ease, and do as
you please.' The upper part of the <em>Old House</em> is raising more cause for mistrust,
since the old building is overweighted and crushed with a mass of <em>Taxes</em>, piled
on the roof, the accumulated pressure of 'the accursed ten years' American war,
fomented by the Opposition and misconducted by a timid Minister.' A light
balcony has been thrown out, and therein things are proceeding in true showman
style. Burke is officiating as exhibitor, and blowing through a trumpet;
another statesman is doing the harlequin-business; merry-andrew 'Sherry' is
flourishing his bottle and dancing round the corner of the balcony, on which is
a placard announcing a wonderful combination of attractions: 'The Scarlet Woman
of Babylon, the Devil, and the Pope.' 'The Man of the People' is pictured as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_115" id="Page_i_115">[115]</a></span>
a feather,&mdash;on the flag of the party. The sign of the <em>Old House, Magna Charta</em>,
has fallen to tatters, and the board is dropping down; two lawyers, who appear at
the window, are repairing the edifice according to their theories; one of the props
of the edifice, <em>the Lords</em>, is spared, but the other, <em>prerogative of the Crown</em>, is being
lopped off by one of the legal magnates. The King is turning his back on the
place, and starting in a state coach on his way to Hanover, deaf and blind to
the prayers of some of his subjects, who are imploring the royal compassion
on their knees. <em>The Sun of England's Glory</em> is setting in the distance, and an
eye of light, piercing through the clouds, is warning the retiring monarch to
'Turn out these robbers and repair the House.'</p>

<p><i>February 3.</i> <cite>The Infant Hercules.</cite>&mdash;Another caricature was directed against
the ex-Coalition Ministers, representing them as twin serpents whose tails
('American War' and 'East India Bill') are entwined; the heads of Fox
and North appear on the shoulders of the monster. Pitt is figured as the infant
Hercules; he has taken his seat on the 'Shield of Chatham,' and has grasped the
throats of the serpents, the tails of which are already lopped off. 'These,' he
cries, 'were your Ministers.'</p>

<div class="caption">BRITANNIA ROUSED, OR THE COALITION MONSTERS DESTROYED.</div>
</div>

<p><i>February 3, 1784.</i> <cite><a href="#BRITANNIA_ROUSED">Britannia Roused</a>, or the Coalition Monsters Destroyed.</cite>&mdash;Britannia,
the symbolical goddess, is fairly aroused, and her greatness and power
are effectually asserted on the persons of the late Ministers. Her strong arm is
throttling the lethargic Lord North, and she has seized the body of Fox, whose
person she is dashing over her head, in a manner which threatens the extinction
of the popular idol.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_117" id="Page_i_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>The East India Company and its Corporation became, for a time, the chief
bone of contention. Fox had gone out of office on the rejection of his provisions
for the proper regulation of our Eastern Empire,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and Pitt, on coming into
power, introduced his own motion with the same object. The view of the public
on this point was expressed by Rowlandson's satirical summary of the situation.</p>

<p><i>February 7, 1784.</i> <cite>Billy Lackbeard and Charley Blackbeard Playing at Football.</cite>&mdash;Fox
and Pitt are both kicking with a will; the football is the old House of
John Company, Leadenhall Street; the edifice is turned upside down, and the
rival players are succeeding in keeping the vast concern suspended in the air
between them. <em>Billy Lackbeard</em> has just turned from the study of Blackstone,&mdash;an
allusion to the youth of the Prime Minister. It is interesting to remember
that Pitt had resigned his ambitious mind seriously to the study and practice of
the law, in case the progress of events should deprive him of Parliamentary
significance. The commencement of his career was somewhat troublous, especially
during the 'Regency struggle,' when the state of the King's health
rendered the accession of the Prince of Wales probable, in which case the
governing power would have remained in the hands of his more experienced
rival. Behind Fox is a dicebox, and at his feet lie packs of playing-cards, indicating
that gambling was the only resource left him, if he could not succeed in
regaining office.</p>

<p>The influence which was being brought to bear, through illegitimate channels,
to strengthen the party of Pitt's followers, who found themselves in such a
minority as to be powerless at first, was recognised and commented on out of
doors. The satirists freely exposed the Ministerial man&oelig;uvres; it was evident
that the Court party, and especially the King, would count no sacrifice too great,
could they but contrive to prevent the return of the members of the late Coalition
Ministry to power, this hostility being intensified by the prejudices borne in the
royal mind against Fox.</p>

<p>So strongly did this influence work that we find in <cite>The Morning Post and
Daily Advertiser</cite> for February 10, 1784, the names of twenty-two members
who had fallen under the spell of Ministerial beguilements. The advertisement
is quite simple, and appears without either comment or explanation; the heading
is pictorial, and represents a string of rats&mdash;such as might preface an ordinary
rat-catcher's advertisement&mdash;it is placed above the name of Jack Robinson, in
capital letters. Then follow, in three short columns, the names of the twenty-two
Parliamentary rats who had gone over to the good pickings which the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_118" id="Page_i_118">[118]</a></span>
was able to hold forth as a temptation in return for the allegiance of these
renegades.</p>

<p>This curious advertisement is repeated in a satirical print which Rowlandson
prepared on the same subject.</p>

<p><i>March 1, 1784.</i> <cite><a href="#THE_APOSTATE">The Apostate Jack Robinson</a>, the Political Rat-catcher.
N.B. Rats taken alive.</cite>&mdash;Before the door of the Treasury, from whence the
converter of rats draws his supply of baits and lures, travelling cautiously on
all fours and feeling his way, the political rat-catcher is slily augmenting his
captures. Round the apostate Jack's waist hangs the <em>cestus of corruption</em>, in his
pocket is a little aide-de-camp, who is made to cry, 'We'll ferret them out!' On
his back is a double trap, baited with miniature coronets, places, &amp;c.; one or two
rats have been secured in this; golden pieces strew the floor, and with these the
rats to be captured are playing and coquetting. A large bait of pension is held
to the nose of one grave old veteran, probably intended for Edmund Burke, and
the other rats are watching the bait with longing looks. A placard is pinned
on the wall, 'Jack Robinson, Rat-catcher to Great Britain. Vermin preserved.'
Under the heading of 'Rats of Note' is given the very list of apostates as published
in the <cite>Morning Post</cite>, beneath Jack Robinson's patronymic.</p>

<p><i>March 3, 1784.</i> <cite>A Peep into Friar Bacon's Study.</cite>&mdash;A spectacle of conjuration,
which discloses matters of some historical moment. In the centre of the
picture stands the brazen head which is giving forth its oracles. King George
the Third, who has thrown a conjuror's cloak over his star and riband, is holding
out two divining-rods, and questioning the head&mdash;'What is this?' To this the
magic bust is giving forth these oracle-like phrases: 'Time is, Time was, Time
is past;' while three luminous circles, each bordered with the word <em>Constitution</em>,
help to illuminate the obscurity of the revelation. The first view of the Constitution,
'Time is past,' displays the King on his throne, with a radiance like the
sun; the other bodies of the State barely come within the charmed circle; the
Houses of Lords and Commons appear mere 'air balloons.' 'Time is' offers
another view of the Constitution; the King's circle has diminished, that of the
House of Peers is increasing in magnitude and becoming bound up with the royal
circle; the House of Commons, without infringing on either, has arrived within
the circumference of the Constitution; and in the third view we find the three
circles assimilated in size and working one within the other&mdash;the Constitution in
its perfected form, in fact. Behind the King the members of the late Ministry
are appearing at a door. Fox, North, and Burke are in the front rank; they
bid the monarch 'Beware!' The King's friends, led by an imp of Satan, or,
perhaps, by the Devil in person, are finding their way down the back-stairs.
Foremost is a figure bearing a lantern, which is throwing a light on the movements
of the Opposition. Lord Temple, and other influential supporters of the Ministry,
are making their entry on the scene, and crying, 'We must destroy this coalition,'
'A fig for the resolutions,' &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>March 8, 1784.</i> <cite><a href="#MASTER_BILLY">Master Billy's Procession to Grocers' Hall</a>.</cite>&mdash;Pitt has, according
to the picture, supplemented his Parliamentary tactics by flattering the citizens,
and bidding for the Corporation influence. He is drawn going to <em>Grocers' Hall</em>
in state to receive the freedom of the City in a gold box, which is carried at the
head of the procession. Great enthusiasm prevails, as a liberal gentleman, in
the uniform of a naval officer, is distributing handfuls of coin amongst the mob.
Banners are carried in the procession with the party watchwords, '<em>Pitt and prerogative</em>,'
and '<em>Youth is a most enormous crime</em>.' The car of Sir Watney, drawn
by satyrs comes first; then, in the middle, perched up in a triumphal car, and
with a feather in his hat, comes Master Billy, drawn, of course, by <em>King's men</em>.
Sir Barney follows, drawn by his admirers, and shouting, 'Pitt and plum-pudding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_120" id="Page_i_120">[120]</a></span>
for ever!' The show is passing the shop of 'Tommy Plume, grocer to his
Majesty;' this worthy, who is crying, 'O what a charming youth!' is seen at
his window, surrounded by shouting spectators. At the sign of the <em>Lord
Chatham</em> is gathered another party of sightseers; they are enthusiastically
declaring that 'Master Pitt is very like his father!'</p>

<p><i>March 11, 1784.</i> <cite>The Champion of the People.</cite>&mdash;The sturdy figure of Fox,
clad in somewhat theatrical armour, and protected by the <em>Shield of Truth</em>, is
resolutely combating the overgrown <em>Hydra</em> of patronage, whose growing and
unconstitutional power&mdash;it was hinted&mdash;would shortly destroy the liberty of the
subject. The monster, a compound of the Pittite party and its royal supporter,
is hissing and spitting venom with all its various heads, <em>Tyranny</em>, <em>Assumed Prerogative</em>,
<em>Despotism</em>, <em>Oppression</em>, <em><a href="#SECRET_INFLUENCE">Secret Influence</a></em>, and <em>Scotch Politics</em>; while
three heads have been already lopped off by the champion's sword, <em>Duplicity</em>
and <em>Corruption</em> are laid in the dust. The foreign Powers are represented in
alliance, and dancing round the <em>Standard of Sedition</em>. Natives, of the subject
East Indian races, are kneeling and blessing their champion; and a compact
array of <em>English and Irish supporters</em> is drawn up under the standard of
'<em>Britannia and Universal Liberty</em>.' Fox's followers are respectively declaring,
'While he protects us, we will support him;' and 'He gave us a free trade, and
all we asked; he shall have our firm support!'</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_121" id="Page_i_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p><i>March 26, 1784.</i> <cite>The State Auction.</cite>&mdash;This print illustrates the pass to
which, as it was assumed, the Constitution was coming under the evil effects of
the undue extension of the royal prerogative. The 'State Auction' is held, under
high patronage, in the '<em>Commission warehouse; money advanced on all sorts of
useless valuables, by Pitt and Co., Auctioneers. N.B. Licensed by Royal Authority.</em>'
Pitt, seated on his rostrum, under the royal arms, is knocking down
'State property' in the capacity of auctioneer. The first lot is, it seems, the most
interesting one in the sale: 'The Rights of the People, in 558 volumes.' Pitt's
friend Dundas is acting as sale porter. 'Show the lot this way, Harry,' cries
the auctioneer. 'Agoing, agoing; speak quick, or it's gone. Hold up the lot, ye
Dund ass!' To which invitation the Scot, Dundas, who has been doing his
best to help Master Pitt, responds, 'I can hould it na higher, sir!' Pitt is
favouring the biddings of the 'Hereditary Virtuosi,' a compact knot of Peers
and 'the King's friends;' at their head stands Lord Chancellor Thurlow, who is
disparaging the Opposition. 'Mind not the nonsensical biddings of those common
fellows.' The 'chosen representatives' of the people are standing by themselves,
apart from the bidders; their backs are turned upon the entire proceedings,
and they are apparently leaving the sale-room <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</i>, by way of protest, at the
same time exclaiming, 'Adieu to Liberty!' 'Despair not!' and 'Now or never!'
Fox alone is making a resolute stand; he cries, 'I am determined to bid with
spirit for lot 1&mdash;he shall pay dear for it that outbids me.' The lots are of
general interest. Lot 2 is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magna Charta</i>; lot 3 is '<em>Obsolete Public Acts</em>;' lot
4, the Sword of Justice; lot 5, the Mace; lots 6 and 7, legal wigs and gowns,
&amp;c. The sale-clerk, recording the biddings on the parchments of 'sundry Acts,'
is declaring gleefully, 'We shall get the supplies by this sale!'</p>

<p><i>March 29, 1784.</i> <cite>The Drum-Major of Sedition.</cite>&mdash;The portrait of Major
John Cartright, one of the most energetic and disinterested Reformers, is given
under this title. The Major is firmly grasping a pole of Liberty in his right
hand, and is holding forth in front of the hustings erected for the election,
round which are gathered numerous voters and a crowd of others, who are being
addressed from the platform. Admiral Lord Hood is introduced, shouting, 'Two
faces under a Hood!' The speech made by the Drum-Major of Sedition has a
strong ironical tendency. 'All gentlemen and other electors for Westminster
who are ready and willing to surrender their rights and those of their fellow-citizens
to secret influence, and the <em>Lords of the Bedchamber</em>, let them repair to
the prerogative standard, lately erected at the Cannon Coffee House, where they
shall be kindly received&mdash;until their services are no longer wanted. This, gentlemen,
is the last time of asking, as we are determined to abolish the power of the
House of Commons, and in future be governed by Prerogative, as they are in
France and Turkey. Gentlemen, the ambition of the enemy is now evident.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_122" id="Page_i_122">[122]</a></span>

the Chancellor<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> was taking a bottle with a female favourite, as all great men
do? I am informed, gentlemen, that the enemy now assumes Regal Authority,
and, by virtue of the Great Seal (which he stole), is creating of peers and
granting of pensions. A most shameful abuse, gentlemen, of that instrument.
If you assist us to pull down the House of Commons, every person
who hears me has a chance of becoming a great man, if he is happy enough
to hit the fancy of Lord Bute and of Mr. Jenkinson. Huzza! God save the
King!'</p>

<p><i>March 30, 1784.</i> <cite>Sir Cecil's Budget for Paying the National Debt.</cite>&mdash;Sir
Cecil Wray, in spite of his Ministerial friends, does not seem to have been a
popular candidate after he had deserted the Liberal party; indeed, he became the
mere puppet of the hour, the Ministerial struggles of the '<em>King's friends</em>' being
not so much directed to bringing in their nominee, as to inflict the mortification
of a defeat on Fox. Two unfortunate projects, which Sir Cecil Wray had originated,
were perpetually used against him by his opponents; these were his proposals
to abolish Chelsea Hospital and to tax maid-servants. In the print '<cite>Sir
Cecil's Budget for paying the National Debt</cite>' has been accepted, and Chelsea
Hospital is brought to the ground, involving in its destruction all the disabled
veterans for whom the country was bound to provide. Sir Cecil is shown in the
distance, exposed to very humiliating treatment; a pensioner, who has escaped
the downfall of the Hospital, is whipping him forward with his crutch, while a
group of female servants, with pails and brooms, are visiting on his person,
the injustices they anticipated. 'Tax servant-maids, you brute, and starve poor old
soldiers&mdash;a fine Member of Parliament!' While in office Fox had proposed a
tax upon receipts, which was loudly cried down by his Tory opponents; it was
now written of <span class="locked">Wray:&mdash;</span></p>

a new play, lately acted in Westminster with distinguished applause.</cite> Act ii.,
scene last.&mdash;The faithful Commons are still suffering from the aggressive tendencies
of the White Horse of Hanover, which is trampling on '<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magna Charta</cite>,'
'<cite>Bill of Rights</cite>', and '<cite>Constitution</cite>,' kicking, rearing, and driving the members
of the 'faithful Commons' forth with his heels. The brute is neighing out
'<em>Pre-ro-ro-ro-ro-rogative</em>;' while Pitt, a remarkably light jockey, is encouraging
the excitement of the brute: 'Bravo! go it again; I love to ride a mettle steed.
Send the vagabonds packing.' The sturdy person of Fox is safely astride the
British Lion; the royal beast has quitted his place in the army of England,
leaving the notice, '<em>We shall resume our situation here at pleasure.&mdash;Leo Rex.</em>'
He is keeping a watchful eye on the Hanoverian Horse, and protesting, 'If this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_124" id="Page_i_124">[124]</a></span>
horse is not tamed he will soon be absolute king of our forest.' Fox has come
on the scene prepared to render efficient assistance; he is provided with a bit and
bridle, and a stout riding-whip, to tame and control the high-mettled Hanoverian
steed. 'Prithee, Billy,' he is crying to Pitt, 'dismount before ye get a fall&mdash;and
let some abler jockey take your seat!'</p>

<p><i>April 3, 1784.</i> <cite>The Two Patriotic Duchesses on their Canvass; requesting the
favour of an early poll.</cite>&mdash;The zealous canvassers for 'the Champion of the
people' are enlisting the sympathies of possible voters. Their mode of procedure
is shown at a butcher's stall, according to the satirist's view of their
patriotic exertions. The Duchess of Devonshire, wearing the Prince of Wales's
plume in her hat, above an immense favour <em>for Fox</em>, has placed one arm round
the waist of a young butcher, and, with her left hand, is pushing a well-filled
purse into his pocket; at the same time she is cementing the compact with a
chaste kiss. Farther on is seen the Duchess of Portland, who is attempting to
beguile another butcher's apprentice; but she is less successful, probably because
her personal attractions will not bear comparison with the graces of the winning
Georgiana.</p>

<p><i>April 4, 1784.</i> <cite>The Incurable.</cite>&mdash;Fox, in a strait-jacket, with straw disposed

contesting the 'great fight' for the representation of Westminster are represented
according to their supposititious characteristics. Fox, with his hand on his heart,
and his arm held out in a declamatory attitude, stands for <em>Demosthenes</em>; Hood is
introduced as <em>Themistocles</em>; and Wray is less flatteringly served up in the character
of <em>Judas Iscariot</em>. It must be remembered that '<em>the Knight of the Back-stairs</em>'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_125" id="Page_i_125">[125]</a></span>
had been nominated for the previous Parliament by Fox, with whom he
had shared the representation of Westminster, but Wray thought fit to desert
to the Tories and oppose his political leader, forsaking his friends and his principles
for the sake of promised Ministerial patronage.</p>

round his head, is parodied as the sanctimonious <em>Mother Cole</em>; a bottle of 'Constitution
Cordial,' to sustain her sinking spirits, is placed by her side. Fox, as
<em>Loader</em>, with his dicebox thrown to the ground, is listening, handkerchief in
hand, to <em>Old Moll's</em> lamentations. 'Ay, I am going, a-wasting, and a-wasting.

greasy butcher, whom she is favouring with a salute in the zeal of patriotism;
another fair canvasser (possibly the Duchess of Gordon), rejoicing in proportions
more expanded than those of the beautiful Georgiana, is seconding the proceeding;
while, shouting 'Huzza, Fox for ever!' a lusty butcher, with his tray
under his arm, is cheering and hurrying up to share his possible reward.</p>

as the trusty guardian, standing unmoved and at his ease amidst the

<p><i>April 12, 1784.</i> <cite>The Poll.</cite>&mdash;The scene is still the polling-booth, Covent
Garden; the canvassers, committees, and mobs are giving their entire attention
to the performance carried on for their entertainment between the fair rival
advocates, who are balanced at either end of a plank laid across a stone post.
The Duchess of Devonshire is sent up into the air; her end of the poll is carried
over Fox's head; '<em>Duke and no Duke, a play</em>,' is placarded above her.</p>

<p>The opposite extreme of <em>the poll</em> is weighed down effectually by the weight
of a corpulent lady, described in these election squibs as <em>Madame Blubber</em>, the
Honourable Mrs. Hobart (Lady Buckinghamshire), of <em>Pic-Nic</em> notoriety. Hood
is cheating by kneeling down and clinging to the skirts of the Ministerial
championess, he lends an additional weight to his side of the balance; behind
them is Wray, defying his opponent. Over the heads of this group flutters a
placard, '<em>The Rival Candidates, a farce</em>.'</p>

<p>The Opposition party dwelt mainly upon Sir Cecil Wray's renegade want of
principle in turning against his leader, Fox. His liberality was severely called in
question, and there was a satirical story of his keeping nothing in his cellar but
small beer. The old symbolism of slavery and France&mdash;wooden shoes&mdash;was
revived for the occasion; much stress was laid on the extensive polling of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_128" id="Page_i_128">[128]</a></span>
soldiers for Hood and Wray at the beginning of the election, when on one
occasion two hundred and eighty of the Guards were sent in a body to give their
votes as householders. This, Horace Walpole observes, <em>was</em> legal, 'but which my
father (Sir Robert) in the most quiet sessions would not have dared to do.'
All dependents on the Court were commanded to vote on the same side as the
soldiers. The following placard, which was put out early in the canvass, is a
fair example of the courtesies with which the Ministerial man&oelig;uvres were acknowledged
by their <span class="locked">opponents:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>'All <em>Horse Guards</em>, <em>Grenadier Guards</em>, <em>Foot Guards</em>, and <em>Black Guards</em> that
have not polled for the destruction of <em>Chelsea Hospital</em> and the <em>tax on maid-servants</em>
are desired to meet at the <em>Gutter Hole</em>, opposite the Horse Guards,
where they will have a full bumper of <em>knock-me-down</em> and plenty of <em>soapsuds</em>,
before they go to the poll for Sir Cecil Wray or eat.</p>

<p>'N.B. Those that have no shoes or stockings may come without, there <em>being
a quantity of wooden shoes provided for them</em>.'</p>

<p><i>April 14, 1784.</i> <cite><a href="#LORDS_OF">Lords of the Bedchamber</a>.</cite>&mdash;The Duchess of Devonshire,
in her morning gown and cap, is favouring two privileged visitors with a cup of
tea in her boudoir.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_129" id="Page_i_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>The Duchess is attending to the tea urn; above her head hangs the Reynolds
portrait of her liege lord. Sam House, in his publican's jacket, is seated, stirring
a cup of tea, on the sofa beside Fox, who is familiarly patting his friend and
indefatigable ally on his bald head by way of friendly encouragement.</p>

<p>Sam House was one of the most popular figures of his day, and he came into
especial prominence, as we have seen, during the Fox's canvass. He is said to
have kept open house during the Westminster Election at his own expense, and
was honoured by entertaining the great Whig nobility. He was an indefatigable
supporter of Fox, and his assistance was, as may be supposed, of no trifling
moment to the cause.</p>

<p><i>April 20, 1784.</i> <cite>The Covent Garden Nightmare.</cite>&mdash;This subject is a parody
on a painting by Fuseli. Rowlandson has taken the idea and fitted it to the
purpose of an electioneering squib. Fox is represented stretched in an uneasy
slumber, nightmare-ridden. An unearthly incubus oppresses his body and
haunts his repose; a corpulent imp is crouched on his hams pressing the great
man's chest, while the head and shoulders of a supernatural mare are shown
making their appearance through the bed-curtains. On a table by Fox's side are
shown the dice and dicebox, the satirist's inevitable resource when dealing with
the frailties of the 'man of the people,' who, it must be confessed, had in his day
committed sufficient excesses in the way of gambling; a vice he absolutely
renounced in after-life, but not before it had ruined his purse, imperilled his
reputation, and proved a fruitful source of recrimination in the mouths of his
enemies.</p>

<p><i>April 22, 1784.</i> <cite>Madame Blubber on her Canvass.</cite>&mdash;We find the Duchess
of Devonshire and the Honourable Mrs. Hobart&mdash;the most prominent of the fair
electioneering agents who threw the power of their personal charms into the
political arena&mdash;scandalised alternately; her Grace the fascinating Georgiana was
represented as a softening influence by which the votes of the butchers were
secured; we find Pitt's fair champion, <em>Madame Blubber</em> (Lady Buckinghamshire),
endeavouring to cajole the same classes in identical fashion. The lady, who, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_130" id="Page_i_130">[130]</a></span>
must be acknowledged, was somewhat stout, is trying her hand amongst the
rough sellers of meat; she is holding out a purse as a bait, saying, 'Hood and
Wray, my dear butcher;' the butcher's dogs are regarding the canvasser suspiciously;
their master, at ease in his armchair, without moving his pipe from his
mouth, is puffing out bluntly, 'I'm engaged to the Duchess!' 'Pho! give her a
glass,' suggests the butcher's friend, who is drinking punch with him from a
bowl on which is the figure of a fox, the chopping-block serving as their table.
<em>Madame Blubber</em> has a train of appreciative butcher's men in her wake; one is
declaring that she is 'the fattest cattle he ever handled!' a drover is observing,
'Lincolnshire, dammee!' and a lad with a tray pronounces her a 'plumper!'</p>

<p><i>April 22, 1784.</i> <cite><a href="#WITS_LAST">Wit's Last Stake</a>, or the Cobbling Voter and Abject Canvassers.</cite>&mdash;Every
stratagem which could secure the popular voice for either candidate was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_131" id="Page_i_131">[131]</a></span>
freely put in practice; but while the Pittites resorted to threats and force, Fox
and his adherents relied mainly on persuasion and good humour. <cite>Wit's last
Stake</cite> shows the exertions made in the canvassing department. Fox is in the
centre of the picture, giving his knee as a seat for his fair advocate, the Duchess
of Devonshire, who is resorting to a subterfuge commonly employed as a precaution
against actions for bribery at elections, by the stall of a cobbler, who
happens to be a voter: her Grace has discovered that her shoe requires a stitch;
the cobbler, with his tongue thrust out at the side of his mouth, is working at
the supposititious repairs with pantomimic energy; meanwhile his wife is receiving
in payment for the job a handful of sovereigns from her Grace's purse. The
scene takes place in Peter Street, and the cobbler's board announces, '<em>Shoes made
and mended by Bob Stichett, cobbler to her Grace the tramping Duchess</em>.' A fox's
brush is being waved overhead out of the first-floor window by a supporter,
who has been provided with pipe and pot at the Whig expense. Fox is giving
his right hand to another voter, a tattered and stupified-looking scavenger, to
whom Sam House is also administering comfort in the shape of a pot of porter.
Among other followers of the 'Man of the People' Rowlandson has introduced a
chimney-sweeper and his boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_132" id="Page_i_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Fox's canvass was enlivened by the rough humours of the various classes
whose favour he required to enlist; his own good-nature was equal to every
emergency. One blunt tradesman, whose vote he solicited, replied, 'Mr. Fox,
I cannot give you my support; I admire your abilities, but <span class="locked">d&mdash;&mdash;</span> your principles!'
To which the candidate smartly responded, 'My friend, I applaud you
for your sincerity, but <span class="locked">d&mdash;&mdash;</span> your manners!'</p>

<p>In another instance Fox's application to a saddler in the Haymarket for his
interest was met with a practical joke&mdash;the man produced a <em>halter</em>, with which
he expressed his willingness to oblige the statesman. Said Fox, 'I return you
thanks, my friend, for your intended present; but I should be sorry to deprive
you of it, as I presume it must be a <em>family piece</em>.'</p>

<p><i>April 22, 1784.</i> <cite>King's Place, or a View of Monsieur Reynard's Best Friends.</cite>&mdash;Another
gathering of Fox's fair adherents. The Prince of Wales, surrounded
by fashionably-dressed nymphs, wearing one of Fox's favours below his plume,
and with a fox-brush in his hand, is speaking in his friend's favour: 'He
supported my cause!' A pleasingly-drawn female&mdash;probably intended to suggest
Mrs. Robinson, the <em>Perdita</em> of the Prince's early love-story&mdash;is asserting, 'He is
as generous as a prince, and a prince should not be limited!' A group of Lady
Abbesses are also saying 'good things' in their candidate's favour: 'He introduced

money. Fox for ever. Huzza!'</p>

<p><i>April 22, 1784.</i> <cite>Political Affection.</cite>&mdash;The Duchess of Devonshire is still
slandered by the satirists; according to the present unjust version her 'political
affection' is causing her to neglect her infant, the heir of the Cavendishes, to
lavish her tenderness on a hybrid prodigy, a fox dressed up in the robes of an
infant. By the side of a neglected cradle is seen a cat, forgetting her kitten to
lick the face of a poodle.</p>

<p>This coarse hostility to the Duchess was probably popular in its day, as we
find a long series of allusions conceived in the same spirit.</p>

<p><i>April 23, 1784.</i> <cite>Reynard put to his Shifts.</cite>&mdash;The artists always took care to
draw the Duchess of Devonshire as handsome and graceful as possible, even
when their satires were most reckless and unsparing; while they descended to
outrage the lady's fair reputation by innuendoes which were utterly unwarrantable.
The beauteous Devon is standing in the middle of the picture, filled, as usual,
with animation for the Whig cause; she is offering the shelter of her protection
to a panting and frightened fox, whose pursuers are following fast on his brush.
A huntsman is encouraging his hounds: 'Tally O! my good dogs!' 'No Coalition,'
'No India Bill,' and other party utterances are put into the mouths of
the pack.</p>

<p><i>April 29, 1784.</i> <cite><a href="#THE_CASE">The Case is Altered</a>.</cite>&mdash;The election has gone against Sir
Cecil Wray, and he has to turn elsewhere; Fox, it will be remembered, in addition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_133" id="Page_i_133">[133]</a></span>
to his return for Westminster, was elected for Kirkwall (Scotland), and in
the print he is shown driving his discomfited opponent to Lincoln.</p>

<p>The Ministerial candidate is not travelling with a flourish of trumpets, but is
smuggled off in the 'Lincolnshire caravan for paupers;' the knight is reflecting
over his reverses: 'I always was a poor dog, but now I am worse than ever.'
Fox is acting as charioteer; he is saying, over his shoulder, 'I will drive you
to Lincoln, where you may superintend the <em>small beer and brickdust</em>.'</p>

<p>Lord Hood, who has come upon this conveyance suddenly, is moved with
pity for his late colleague; he cries, 'Alas! poor Wray.'</p>

<p>As the increasing number of votes gave fresh spirit to the Foxites, satirical
squibs, and songs exulting over Wray's possible downfall and his future fate,
were plentifully put forth by the wits of the Opposition. The following specimen

<p><i>April 29, 1784.</i> <cite>Madame Blubber's Last Shift, or the Ærostatic Dilly.</cite>&mdash;This
caricature pictures the hustings at Covent Garden, with a distant view of
Richmond Hill. <em>Madame Blubber</em> has patriotically contrived to convert herself
into an air-balloon, for the collection and conveyance of <em>outlying voters</em>, crying,
'This may save him,' an allusion to some incident in the canvass. A brace of
voters have been secured in the parachute of this novel Ærostatic Dilly; these
favoured gentlemen are enabled to take a flying view from their elevation of
the hustings below. Wray and Hood are anxiously looking forward to the
arrival of their balloon. According to the inscription given on the plate, in the
artist's hand, the print represents 'The grand political Balloon, launched at
Richmond Park, on the&mdash;March, 1784, and discharged by secret influence with
great effect in Covent Garden at 12 o'clock on the same day.</p>

14.)&mdash;Fox's supporters, a body of highly respectable householders, wearing huge
Fox favours in their hats, are walking in procession to the hustings, cheered by
the mob, and preceded by a marrowbone-and-cleaver accompaniment. At the
head of the train marches the famous Duchess, with a somewhat novel standard;
the other fair canvassers, whose portraits occur in the previous prints, are following
in the footsteps of their illustrious leader; one is carrying a placard, '<em>Fox and
the Rights of the Commons</em>;' another has a mob-cap and an apron, borne fluttering
on a pole, with the words, '<em>No tax on Maid-servants</em>.' Behind follows a monster
key&mdash;<em>the key of the back-stairs</em>&mdash;carried to deride the defeated candidate and the
Court influence which had vainly been brought into play for his support.</p>

<p><i>May 1, 1784.</i> <cite>Every Man has his Hobby-horse.</cite>&mdash;The successful candidate
is chaired in a novel and agreeable fashion; his noble supporter, the Duchess of
Devonshire, has taken him 'pick-a-back,' and, with staff and scrip, is bearing
the victor on his triumphant progress; she is pausing at the door of <em>Mungo's
Hotel, dealer in British spirits</em>, and soliciting the hospitality of the proprietor,
a black man: 'For the good of the Constitution, give me a glass of gin!'</p>

<p>Various bacchanalian revels are proceeding around, on the strength of Fox's
triumphant return; the mob are huzzaing around two monster standards, which
are topped by the cap of Liberty, and inscribed, '<em>Rights of the Commons. No
prerogative</em>,' '<em>Fox and Liberty all over the world</em>.' An ensign is introduced, as appropriate
to the occasion, significantly figuring forth a pair of executioner's axes,
bound with a wreath of laurel.</p>

by the successful candidate for Westminster; the Duchess of Devonshire and

<p><i>May 11, 1784.</i> <cite>A Coat of Arms. Dedicated to the Newly-created Earl of
Lonsdale.</cite>&mdash;There is no publisher's name to the plate, which offers a fanciful and
by no means flattering design for an appropriate coat of arms and supporters,
gratuitously presented for the use of Sir James Lowther, <em>the newly-created Earl
of Lonsdale</em>. Two ragged and semi-clad Volunteers, the one minus his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">culottes</i>,
the other without shoes, with the initials W. M. on their crossbelts, form the
supporters of a shield, above which figures the earl's coronet. There are
six quarterings, each filled in with paper scrolls: 'False Musters,' 'False
Certificates for Volunteer Companies,' 'False Returns,' 'Retention of Clothing,'
'Contract for building a man-of-war (cancelled and money returned),'
and 'Retention of Bounty.' The motto of this suggestive escutcheon is, '<em>Who
doubts it?</em>'</p>

<p>Pitt had obtained his first seat in Parliament (1781) through the influence of
Sir James Lowther, described by 'Junius' as 'the contemptuous tyrant of the
North.' In 1784, when the King and his Prime Minister deemed it prudent to
reward the adherents of their party, and at the same time strengthen the Court
influence, by creating a new batch of peers, Pitt repaid his obligation to Lowther
(the Duke of Rutland, Pitt's fellow-student at Cambridge, had enlisted Lowther's
influence in his favour), by raising him to the House of Peers, under the title of
the Earl of Lonsdale, thus overleaping the two inferior stages of the peerage.
It might be supposed that this reward would have been commensurate with his
pretensions, but Earl Lonsdale's name appearing at the bottom of the list of the
newly-created earls published in the <cite>Gazette</cite>, he threatened to reject the earldom,
and means were with difficulty found to appease his irritation.</p>

<p>The wits of the 'Rolliad' made the most of the circumstance: 'Hints from Dr.
Prettyman to the Premier's Porter.&mdash;Let Lord Lonsdale have <em>my Lord</em> and
<em>your Lordship</em> repeated in his ear as often as possible; the apartment hung with
garter blue is proper for his reception.'</p>

<p><i>May 18, 1784.</i> <cite><a href="#WESTMINSTER_DESERTER">The Westminster Deserter</a> Drumm'd out of the Regiment.</cite>&mdash;This
caricature brings the election scenes in Covent Garden to an end; the Court
party is defeated, and the Man of the People has triumphed. Sir Cecil Wray is
handcuffed as a deserter, and is being drummed away from the hustings; he is
exclaiming, 'Help, Churchill! Jackson, help! or I am lost for ever!' It is worthy
of record that Sir Cecil Wray's figure disappears from the caricatures until
1791, when we meet him again with a barrel of small-beer under his arm, assisting
the members of the Opposition (whose ranks he rejoined) to carry out the '<em>hopes
of the party</em>,' as set forth in a famous pictorial satire by Gillray (July 14, 1791).</p>

<p>In the <cite>Westminster Deserter</cite> 'honest Sam House' is drumming away with
a will, and Wray is obliged to run the gauntlet of a line of exasperated Chelsea
Pensioners, who are expressing a wish that '<em>all public deserters may feel public
resentment</em>;' a body of maid-servants are marching in the rear, with shovels,
mops, and brooms, brought out in readinesss to sweep forth their antagonist.
The electioneering mob is divided between hooting the 'Deserter' and applauding
the success of the 'Champion of the People,' who is planting the standard of
Britannia and manfully acknowledging his gratitude to his supporters: 'Friends
and fellow-citizens, I cannot find words to express my feelings to you upon this
victory.'</p>

<p>Fox's difficulties, as regarded his seat for Westminster and the hostilities of
his opponents, the Court party, did not end with the election; the Ministerialists
had from the first declared their intention of demanding a scrutiny if Fox succeeded,
because it was known that, under the circumstances, this would be a long,
tedious, and expensive affair. The returning officer acted partially, and upon
Sir Cecil Wray's application for a scrutiny declined to make his return pending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_140" id="Page_i_140">[140]</a></span>
the investigation. Fox had secured a seat for Kirkwall, so that he was not
hindered from taking his place in the House; and after some months' delay, and
a great deal of fighting on both sides, the High Bailiff, Thomas Corbett, was
ordered to duly return Charles James Fox as Member for Westminster, as is
set forth in a caricature by Rowlandson (<em>see</em> <a href="#Page_i_153">March 1, 1785</a>). Fox subsequently
thought proper to bring an action against the High Bailiff, and that functionary
in return for his perfidy was cast in heavy damages&mdash;a fresh triumph for the
Opposition.</p>

George III. is complacently seated on his throne; once more reassured on the
subject of his Parliament, he is remarking, with self-congratulation, 'I trust we
have got such a Parliament as we wanted.' <em>Secret Influence</em> is represented on
one side by a huge serpent whispering secret counsel to the monarch. The head
of the reptile is that of Lord Temple. Lord Thurlow, on the other side of the
throne, still wearing his Chancellor's wig, his body represented as that of a
monstrous bird of prey, is observing, with his usual overbearing roughness,
'Damn the Commons! the Lords shall rule,' while the Scotch influence, in the
person of Lord Bute, partially concealed behind the throne, is echoing, 'Very
gude, very gude; damn the Commons!'</p>

<p>Britannia, unconscious of her danger, is calmly reposing, with her elbow
resting on her shield, while Fox, who has recognised the dangers which
are threatening the liberty of the people, is trying to rouse the slumberer,
and crying, 'Thieves, thieves! Zounds, awake, madam, or you'll have your
throat cut!'</p>

return until the conclusion of the scrutiny which Sir Cecil Wray thought proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_141" id="Page_i_141">[141]</a></span>
to instigate, the caricaturist hints that, for the time, the Whig leader will be
'left out in the cold' until the question of his return is finally settled. Fox has
accordingly rolled up his India Bill, and is taking a doleful farewell of his fair

<p>This print has nothing of the caricature about it, excepting, perhaps, the

elegant, and the attitudes leave nothing to be desired. Britannia is on her
throne, the British lion is at her feet, and the ocean, with her ships riding
triumphant, is extending as far as can be seen; the figures of <em>Liberty</em> and <em>Fame</em>,
with their respective attributes, are tripping up to the throne, leading the

<p>The 'catch' is performed by the Duchess of Devonshire, Fox, and Lord
North; the grief expressed by the singers is, of course, apocryphal. The
Duchess is leading; she wears a Fox favour in her hat, which is further garnished
with a fox's brush; she is pointing to a tombstone topped with the death's head
and crossbones, and inscribed, 'Here lies poor Cecil Ray.' 'Look, neighbours,
look! Here lies poor Cecil Wray.' 'Dead and turned to clay,' sings Fox; to
which Lord North adds, 'What! old Cecil Wray?' The sharp profile of Burke is
thrust through the door. The pictures hanging round the room are appropriate
to the subject: a committee of foxes are wondering over 'The Fox who has lost
his tail;' 'The Fox and the Crow,' in which sly Reynard is represented as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_143" id="Page_i_143">[143]</a></span>

that Fox should not be left without a place in the newly-constituted
Parliament, and accordingly in the present print&mdash;nearly the last of the series
put forth on the Westminster Election for 1784&mdash;Fox, with a fox's head and
brush, completely dressed in a suit of tartan, is speeding along, on a Highland
pony, away from Kirkwall (for which he took his seat) back to London,
flourishing his plaid, and crying, 'From the heath-covered mountains of Scotia I

new ballad to be sung by a High Character, to the tune of 'The Vicar and Moses.'</cite>
Mark Lane, delin. and fecit. Published by T. Harris, High Street, Marylebone.&mdash;This
caricature sets forth by anticipation the fate of Christopher Atkinson,
M.P., who was sentenced on November 27, 1784, and pilloried November 25,
1785. A print by Gillray (August 12, 1782) gives a view of the trial under the
title of '<em>The Victualling Committee Framing a Report</em>.' Peter Pindar also
makes a poetical allusion to the circumstances. Christopher Atkinson, M.P. for
Heydon, Yorkshire, was convicted of peculation in his semi-official capacity as
corn-factor to the Victualling Board. He was finally tried at the King's Bench for
perjury, found guilty, and expelled from the House of Commons.</p>

<p>In Rowlandson's view of the novel situation of the contractor the pillory is
raised on the Corn Exchange, and the criminal is standing with his head and
hands enclosed in a board, with two dwarf corn-sheaves on either side; the
Sheriffs, with a numerous crowd of citizens, are attending the exhibition, which
Atkinson does not find to his taste. The sentiments of the pilloried contractor
are expounded in a <span class="locked">ballad:&mdash;</span></p>

<h2>SOCIAL CARICATURES.</h2>

<p><i>January 24, 1784.</i> <cite>A Sketch from Nature.</cite> Published by J. R. Smith, 83
Oxford Street.&mdash;This plate is apparently scarce, since the only impression the
writer has seen is one in the French National Collection of Engravings, Paris,
where the admirer of Rowlandson's works will be gratified to discover a very
fair gathering of caricatures by this master, the collection containing certain
scarce subjects which it is difficult to find elsewhere, besides several proofs of
rare plates. The prints throughout are in capital preservation; in several
instances an impression from a rare plate, and a coloured print from the same,
are mounted side by side.</p>

<p><cite>A Sketch from Nature</cite>, which is the first and perhaps the best print of the
Paris series, is rendered, like most of the plates published by J. R. Smith, exceptionally
interesting from the care and delicacy bestowed on the engraving, and
the success with which the tender expressions, which Rowlandson knew so well
how to throw into the faces of his female beauties, are preserved and transferred
to the copper. The subject is engraved in stipple, and, as a print after
Rowlandson, it exhibits unusual quality and finish. The subject is somewhat
hazardous: a situation borrowed from that inexhaustible epic the <cite>Rake's Progress</cite>,
presenting all the license of debauchery, but expressed without coarseness. A
mixed party of nymphs and roysterers are performing bacchanalian orgies; the
'Lady Abbess' has succumbed to her potations, and is slumbering heavily in her
armchair. Punch and wine are flowing indiscriminately; a poodle has come
in for the contents of a punch-glass, which is overturned, and a man in tipsy
wantonness is upsetting a punch-bowl over the dog's head. The arms of a
sweetly pretty Bacchante are entwined round the neck of the maudlin reveller.
Beside the well-filled table sits a youthful military 'blood;' another nymph, whose
adolescent charms are liberally displayed, is seated on the knee of this son of
Mars. The young lady is evidently disposed to be frolicsome, since she is flourishing
in the air a full-bottomed wig, which she has snatched from the head of a
corpulent Silenus, in whom age has failed to bring sober reason or to correct
frivolity; this ancient buck is deservedly getting his face scratched and clawed in
an amorous struggle with a handsome maiden, dressed in a hat and feathers, who
is forcibly repelling the advances of the elderly rake.</p>

<p>1784. <cite><a href="#CURIOSITY">English Curiosity</a>, or the Foreigner Stared out of Countenance.</cite>&mdash;From
this social caricature it seems that some distinguished foreigner was visiting this
country in 1784, whose general appearance was exciting more public attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_146" id="Page_i_146">[146]</a></span>
than would be considered polite. The foreigner is dressed in a gay military
uniform, and has gone to enjoy himself at the theatre; but the eyes of the
audience do little else but stare at his uniform. The identity of this bird of
passage is not very positive at this date. The plate, as a whole, is as characteristic
and well-drawn an example of Rowlandson's etchings as can be found;
the countenances of the spectators are capitally filled in, the various types of
theatre-goers are hit off with spirit, and the female faces and figures are
rendered with remarkable sweetness.</p>

<p><i>July 24, 1784.</i> <cite>1784, or the Fashions of the Day.</cite> H. Repton inv., T.
Rowlandson fecit.&mdash;The Park, with its mixed crowd of fashionable promenaders
and pleasure-seekers, has afforded the designer ample scope for the delineation
of both grotesque and graceful figures, modishly apparelled. In 1784, while the
older generation still clung to the garments characteristic of the earlier Georges,
the younger branches rushed into all the latest innovations&mdash;costumes which are
generally received as distinctive of the end of the last and the beginning of the
present century. Thus to the observer of the picturesque the fashions of 1784
offered the external habits of two distinct epochs. Among other features, indicative
of the introduction of novelties, the artist has represented the parasol,
or more properly the umbrella, then an object likely to occasion remark, as its
general use was just coming into fashion.</p>

<p><i>August 8, 1784.</i> <cite>The Vicar and Moses.</cite> Published by H. Humphrey, 18
New Bond Street.&mdash;A pictorial heading, in Rowlandson's characteristic style, to
the famous old song of '<cite>The Vicar and Moses</cite>,' by G. A. Stevens. The Vicar
has been dragged unwillingly from his ale-cup, by his clerk, to assist at the
burial of a child; the family mourners are waiting in the churchyard, as shown
in the picture; Moses, the clerk, has put on his bands and found the parson's
place in his book, and he is lighting the erratic footsteps of his patron with a
broken candle placed in a horn lantern; as to the rotund dignitary of the Church,
he is reeling along reluctantly; he wears his cassock and bands, as was the daily
fashion at one time, and his hat is thrust well over his full-bottomed wig, which
is somewhat awry; in one hand he retains his faithful pipe, and his tobacco-box<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_148" id="Page_i_148">[148]</a></span>
is held in the other. The verses, which are tolerably well known, offer a
whimsical description of how the Vicar, who happened to be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non si ipse</i> (<i>i.e.</i> 'the
parson was tipsy'), having been disturbed at his meditations over a pot of ale,
was informed that he was required to read the burial service over the body of
one of his flock; the pastor felt strongly inclined to remain where he was, and
proposed to postpone the ceremonial.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Then Moses reply'd:</span>

Etched by Rowlandson. Published by W. Humphrey.</p>

<p><i>November 8, 1784.</i> <cite><a href="#MONEY-LENDERS">Money-Lenders.</a></cite>&mdash;A young nobleman is receiving the
visits of certain usurers. One Hebrew gentleman, the principal, or 'capitalist,'
is dressed with a certain attention to the fashion of the day, which proves that
he is by no means an insignificant member of the money-lending fraternity. A
deed or bond, the security on which the young spendthrift is expecting an
advance, is being duly examined by a more miserly-looking Shylock&mdash;'a little
Jew-broker,' in fact. As to the borrower, it is clearly indicated that he is quite
at his ease in the transaction; it seems evident that whatever money he may
raise (regardless of the sacrifices to which he submits in obtaining it) will be
quickly thrown to the winds, and 'the dose will have to be repeated as before'
until his resources are exhausted.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 647px;">

<div class="caption">MONEY-LENDERS.</div>
</div>

<p><i>September 25, 1784.</i> <cite>Bookseller and Author.</cite>&mdash;A characteristic drawing, in
Rowlandson's best recognised style, bearing the name of Henry Wigstead as
inventor, published by J. R. Smith. The persons of the publisher and author<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_149" id="Page_i_149">[149]</a></span>
present the marked and conventional extreme contrasts which the two spheres of
life were supposed to suggest&mdash;the one gross and prosperous, the other meagre
and miserable. The scene of the interview may be assumed to be the back-shop
of the bookseller; it is fitted around with shelves lined with books. The trader
is stout and solid; his spectacles are thrust up on his forehead, his pen is behind
his ear, and his hands are held beneath his coat-tails, in a self-assertive attitude,
implying well-to-do pomposity.</p>

<p>Wigstead, whose name is associated with authorship (although his professional
position as a magistrate exempted him from the sufferings of a struggling
literary hack), has painted the professional gentleman in no flattering colours;
the man of letters is wretchedly lean in person, and abjectly subservient in
manner to the trafficker who is buying his ideas; his hat is held respectfully under
his arm, and his manuscript, which he is endeavouring to recommend to his
patron, is in his hand. One of the bookseller's clients, a respectable Church
dignitary, who is looking through the library, with great owl-like horn spectacles
on his reverend nose, is present at the interview, and is regarding the poor
literary hack with an air of inflated superiority.</p>

<p>1784. <cite>London, Made and Sold by Broderip and Wilkinson, 13 Haymarket.</cite>&mdash;A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_150" id="Page_i_150">[150]</a></span>
plate for a trade advertisement, introducing the figures Apollo, Daphne, &amp;c., drawn
and etched with considerable grace and spirit. Among Rowlandson's renderings
of the works of other men we may mention a sketch after T. Mortimer, etched by
T. R., 1784. This study portrays the back view of an Italian or Spanish peasant
woman, playing the flute.</p>

<p>1784. <cite>The Historian Animating the Mind of a Young Painter.</cite>&mdash;This subject
represents the painting-room of a young artist, furnished with a drawing-table,
an easel, a couple of chairs, a settee, and a bust, while a few sketches of figure
subjects are pinned on the walls. The painter, who is a well-favoured youth, is
seated with his back to his easel, on which is a classic study in course of execution.
His palette is on the ground, and he is holding a crayon in one hand, and a folio,
which is serving as his drawing-board, in the other, ready to dash down his conceptions
as soon as his imagination is sufficiently inspired by the effects of his
friend's readings. The learned historian, whose hat and gloves are at his feet,
wears a full-bottomed wig and large round rimmed spectacles. His appearance
is somewhat clerical, and he is evidently filled with enthusiasm for the subject
on which he is declaiming, book in hand. The limner's wife, in a morning dress,
is seated by the fire, amusing her infant son, who is standing on her knee in a
nude state, the infant being probably impressed into the service of the fine arts
as the model for a cherubim. No publisher's name is given on this plate, which
is delicately rendered.</p>

<p>1784. The print of a group of three figures; in the centre is a pretty simple
maiden, whose face wears an artless expression, such as Rowlandson excelled in
delineating, seated in an armchair, and grasping the hand of a youth, who has
opened a vein in his arm, while another maid, in a morning cap and dress, is
lending her assistance. The name of R. Batty has been given in MS. as 'sculpsit.'
Both the drawing of the figures and the style of the etching are strongly indicative
of Rowlandson's handiwork.</p>

<p>1784. <cite>Rest from Labour on Sunny Days.</cite> Designed and etched by T.
Rowlandson.&mdash;A peasant is sitting in an easy attitude perched upon the ruins
of a temple, playing the flute; a pretty peasant maid is leaning beside him, with
her dog at her feet. Etching and aquatinta.</p>

<p>1784. <cite>Billingsgate.</cite>&mdash;All the humours of this famous academy of slang are
displayed. The fish-selling fags have their baskets planted in rows in front of
the landing-place. The hampers of the porters and the masts of ships are seen
beyond. The Billingsgate hawkers are offering their fish vociferously for sale,
getting drunk, and generally behaving in the disorderly style attributed to them.
A gouty customer, evidently an epicure, who has come to select a turbot for his
table, is seized unceremoniously by his wig and coat-tails and tripped up in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_151" id="Page_i_151">[151]</a></span>
exertions of a fishfag aided by her urchin to arrest the passer, and call attention
to certain goods she is holding out for inspection.</p>

<p><i>January 7, 1785.</i> <cite>The Fall of Achilles.</cite>&mdash;It was evident from the first that
the chances of the members of the late Coalition Ministry returning to power
were weakened in the new Parliament, and it soon became obvious that, even as
an Opposition, their party was without either weight or influence. Fox in looking
round the recently elected House found himself surrounded by country
gentlemen, Pitt's following, whose faces were unfamiliar to him. Pitt was firmly
settled, the unquestioned master of the situation. It is the youthful Premier
who has come forth, in the character of Paris it is presumed, with a bow and a
quiver of arrows, the better to shoot Whiggism on the wing; he has just sent a
bolt straight into the flying Opposition; the arrow has lodged in the heel of the
mighty Fox, who is represented double the size of his triumphant adversary.</p>

<p>After a smart skirmish, which lasted a considerable time, in which many men were lost on both sides.
But their great ally, at length losing ground, desertions took place, and notwithstanding their vast
superiority in numbers and weight of metal at the first onset, this increased apace, altho' often
rallied by the ablest man in command, till at length the forces gave way in all quarters and they
were totally overthrown. This print is dedicated to the Electors of the City and Liberty of Westminster,

famed Cecilian Forces</cite>, on the plains of St. Martin, on Thursday, the 3rd day of February,
1785, by the Champion of the People and his Chosen Band.&mdash;Fox, at the head
of his party, whose arms are legal weapons, such as <em>Law</em>, <em>Eloquence</em>, <em>Perseverance</em>,
and <em>Truth</em>, is routing and putting to flight the combined forces of his opponents,
led by Sir Cecil Wray and the High Bailiff, Corbett. At the Westminster Election
it will be remembered, Fox had gained the victory over his antagonists;
and the Scrutiny, moved for by Sir Cecil Wray, being concluded, the proper return
was directed to be made; and, as we have mentioned, the successful candidate
brought an action and recovered heavy damages against the High Bailiff (who
had made himself the tool of the Ministerialists). Fox is protected by his
buckler, inscribed 'Majority 38;' he is sweeping away the 'Cecilian forces'
with the sword of 'Justice;' a laurel crown is placed on his brow by a celestial
messenger, who is also charged with the decision of the Court&mdash;'It is ordered
that Thomas Corbett, Esq., do immediately return.' Fox is declaring, 'The
wrath of my indignation is kindled, and I will pursue them with a mighty hand
and outstretched arm until justice is done to those who have so nobly supported
me.' Sir Cecil Wray's shield of <em>Ingratitude</em> is no defence, and his weapon has
snapped short; he is crying in despair, 'My knees wax feeble, and I sink beneath
the weight of my own apostacy!' The High Bailiff is thrown down; he confesses,
'My conscience is now at peace;' an ally is crying, 'Help, help! our chief
is fallen. O conscience, support me!' Corbett's lawyers have turned their
backs on the cause of the client: 'Nor law, nor conscience, nor the aid of potent
Ministers, can e'er support the contest 'gainst such a chief!' 'Our support is
gone and we are fallen into a Pitt; yea, even into a deep Pitt!'</p>

<p><i>March 27, 1785.</i> <cite>The surprising Irish Giant of St. James's Street. 'The
surprising Irish Colossus, King of the Giants, measuring eight feet ten inches;
noble Order of St. Patrick, &amp;c.'</cite>&mdash;The figure of the famous Irish Giant is drawn
with skill and originality by Rowlandson. The person of this colossus, although
gigantic, is graceful, and his proportions are such that the spectators who surround
him are apparently dwarfed to half the usual standard. The giant's right
hand is resting on the head of a military commander, the tallest man in the room,
who, while standing bolt upright, does not reach much above the waistband of
the Irish mammoth. Another officer, while standing on tiptoe on a chair, is
still a full third short of the height of the prodigy. The ladies are struck with
wonder at such gigantic limbs, and one of them is comparing her tiny foot with
the large and well-proportioned member of the giant; while some of the audience
are investing themselves in his top-boots. The skeleton of this remarkable
person is preserved in the Hunterian Museum, College of Surgeons. 'Mr.
Lynn related to-day that the surgeons, in spite of the vigilance of the Irish
Giant's friends, obtained the body for dissection. They made several attempts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_155" id="Page_i_155">[155]</a></span>
to bury it in the Thames, or to convey it to Dover. But the body-hunters
were too keen for all they aimed at; and after keeping the corpse fourteen days
they sold it to John Hunter for 100<i>l.</i> The heart was preserved, and was very
large.... The stature of the skeleton measures eight feet two inches.'&mdash;'MS.

artist has given a grotesque representation of the learned hog, spelling
his words before a delighted audience; the individual characteristics of the
spectators are capitally diversified; their actions and groupings are, as usual,
marked with vivacity. According to a placard over the mantel-piece of the hall
in which this intellectual entertainment was offered we learn: 'The surprising

<p>The incident on which this print was founded occurred, according to the
magazines, &amp;c., in 1785; and, as numerous illustrations appeared at the time, it
seems that the artist has put the date of the year wrongly. <cite>The Waterfall</cite>
represents the Court of King's Bench in an uproar. The members of the Bench
and the Bar, counsellors, attorneys, and clients, suitors and witnesses, are taking to
flight indiscriminately, trampling over one another in their precipitate retreat,
tumbling down the stairs of Westminster Hall, while robes, wigs, and briefs are
lost in the struggle.</p>

<p><i>June 28, 1785.</i> <cite>Vauxhall Gardens.</cite> Engraved by R. Pollard, aquatinted
by F. Jukes. Published by John Raphael Smith.&mdash;It will be remembered by
the reader that, in the earlier part of this sketch of <cite>Rowlandson's Life, Works,
and Times</cite>, special reference is made by the artist's friend and the frequent
companion of his adventures, Henry Angelo, to their expeditions to Vauxhall
Gardens to study character. The varied humours discovered at this popular
resort employed Rowlandson's pencil frequently, as we are told in the <cite>Memoirs</cite>.
It seems, on the authority of those who were most intimate with the caricaturist,
and who were also thoroughly well acquainted with the leading examples of his
skill, that <cite>Vauxhall Gardens</cite> may be accepted as his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef d'&oelig;uvre</i> in the general
estimation. We can compare it to his drawing of the <cite>Tuileries Gardens</cite>, which
is even fuller of diversified groups.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_157" id="Page_i_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>In the famous picture of <cite>Vauxhall</cite> we have the Rotunda, a marvellous construction,
built from the designs of an inventive carpenter, a modest genius, who
obtained a certain celebrity for his ingenuity.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> 'The gilded scallop-shell,' described
by Thackeray in the Vauxhall episode which is introduced in the opening of
<cite>Vanity Fair</cite>, was as it appeared within the writer's recollection, a melancholy,
tawdry substitute for the vanished splendours as noted in Rowlandson's drawing.
A portly lady, standing in front of the orchestra, is warbling ballads to the highly
genteel company, the patrons of the entertainment; of the performers we are
able to offer but scanty particulars.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_158" id="Page_i_158">[158]</a></span></p>
<p>The figure of the fair vocalist is evidently intended for that of Mrs. Weichsel,
a Vauxhall favourite, already mentioned as the mother of the great Mrs. Billington,
the pride of English operatic celebrities. It was at Mrs. Weichsel's
benefit, which Rowlandson attended at 'the little theatre in the Haymarket,'
that our artist produced a sketch of this musical family. To return to Vauxhall,
Angelo and other informants supply us with a hint or two of the company.
Daniel Arrowsmith was engaged as one of the principal singers, 'where Mrs.
Kennedy and that capital bass, Sedgwick, entertained the public for several
seasons.' Joe Vernon, of Drury Lane Theatre, is mentioned among the performers.
Barthelemon was leader of the band; Fisher played the hautboy; and
Mr. Hook was conductor and composer.</p>

<p>To describe the visitors: the most conspicuous figures, which occupy the
centre of the picture, and are exciting the admiring regards of the frequenters of
Vauxhall scattered around them, are understood to be intended for the fascinating
Duchess of Devonshire and her sister, Lady Duncannon. Among the 'freaks
of folly' recorded by our invaluable authority Angelo he mentions having
frequently 'seen many of the nobility, particularly the Duchess of Devonshire,
&amp;c. (the '&amp;c.' expressing a whole crowd of fashionable notorieties), with a large
party, supping in the rooms facing the orchestra, French horns playing to them
all the time.'</p>

<p>Captain Topham, the macaroni-scribbler of fashionable intelligence and
genteel scandalmonger to <cite>The World</cite>, a newspaper of which he was conjointly
proprietor, editor, and principal contributor, is standing upright as a post, dressed
in a smart uniform, and quizzing the fair through his glass. A stout old Commander,
stranded on shore, with only one eye and one leg left from his naval
glories, is planted, lost in admiration, on the Duchess's right. This gallant
veteran is understood to represent Admiral Paisley, the reputed original, according
to the caricaturist, who has drawn his portrait more than once, of '<cite>The Tough
Old Commodore</cite>'&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Why, the bullets and the gout</span>
<span class="i2">Have so knocked his hull about,</span>
<span class="i0">That he'll never like the sea any more!</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>A clerical person over the shoulder of Lady Duncannon is a free rendering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_159" id="Page_i_159">[159]</a></span>
it is hinted, of Bate Dudley, who was the hero of a somewhat notorious
Vauxhall adventure. By the side of the reverend sable-clad editor of the
<cite>Morning Post</cite> stands a handsome figure, dressed in full Highland costume, with
a veritable claymore under his arm, of which the bearer was reported to well
know the use; this gentleman's person is reported to be introduced as a compliment
to another editor, James Perry, of the <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>, who was,
Angelo relates, very expert with the Highland broadsword, its exercise being
his favourite diversion; 'he might be frequently met at masquerades and places
of entertainment, dressed in the costume of a Highlander, with a party of Scotch
lassies, dancing Scotch reels. For variety of steps, Highland flings, &amp;c., he was
particularly noted; crowds collected round him.'</p>

<p>Another conspicuous group introduces the Prince of Wales, afterwards George
the Fourth, then a sweet youth, whose persuasions were supposed to be irresistible,
and 'whose smile was victory;' he is represented whispering soft flatteries
in the ear of a not unwilling fair, whose right hand is held captive under the
arm of a gentleman, presumably her better half. This tender situation is reported
to indicate a well-known episode in the career of the Heir Apparent,
which, although somewhat threadbare, still retains an air of romance. 'Prince
Florizel,' wearing his brilliant star on his breast, is addressing himself covertly to
the most conspicuous figure of the party, the captivating Mrs. Robinson by
general acceptation, the graceful <em>Perdita</em>, in connection with whom, as the artist
has drawn him, the Prince is said to have</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Gazed on the fair</span>
<span class="i4">Who caused his care,</span>
<span class="i0">And sigh'd and look'd, and sigh'd again.</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The lady is coyly trifling with a trinket suspended by a chain round her shapely
throat, possibly the identical locket affectingly alluded to by the 'British Sappho'
(as not impartial admirers subsequently dubbed the fair poetess) in her Memoirs;
this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gage d'amour</i>, which is almost historical in the chronicle of small affections,
containing Prince George's portrait, then a handsome, fine-complexioned youth,
with a profusion of fair hair, as painted in miniature by Meyer, was presented in
an early stage of the flirtation to the lady, through Lord Malden, the <em>Leporello</em> of
the transaction. Within the case of this tribute of tenderness was a heart,
appropriately cut in paper, on one side of which was inscribed, '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je ne change
qu'en mourant</i>;' and on the other, '<em>Unalterable to my Perdita through life</em>;' a
lover's protestation which was not remarkably verified by the subsequent inconstancy
of the impressible <em>Florizel</em>.</p>

<p>Within a supper-box&mdash;one of those grotesque-looking cabinets which many
who have visited the shades of Vauxhall may still bear in vivid remembrance&mdash;is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_160" id="Page_i_160">[160]</a></span>
assembled another convivial party, the members of which have been described&mdash;we
are inclined to suspect without any sufficiently valid foundation&mdash;as the
representatives of an illustrious and very familiar literary coterie. A stout
personage, in the centre, of massive proportions, has been adopted as a free
rendering of the person of the famous Doctor Johnson, who is pictured as characteristically
intent on his supper, and indifferent alike to his company and
the sprightly society which surrounds his box; seated in a corner, on the great
lexicographer's left, anecdotic Boswell is shown, pausing, open-mouthed, to catch
the good things that may fall from his eminent leader; Mrs. Thrale, on Johnson's
right, is saying something very pertinent to Oliver Goldsmith, who is endeavouring
to carve the contents of his plate. His stolid features do not express anything
approaching to rapturous appreciation of the accomplished blue-stocking's extraordinary
flow of bewitching conversation.</p>

<p>Before we leave the attractive vicinity of <cite>Vauxhall Gardens</cite>, as its picturesque
humours were noted by an able hand a century ago, we must offer a few traits of
the delightful old haunt and the wicked ways of its frequenters. Our inexhaustible
informant Angelo is considerate enough to enlighten our more repressive generation
on the practices of the period.</p>

<p>The dashers of the day, instead of returning home in the morning from
Vauxhall, used to repair to the Star and Garter, at Richmond; and, on some
occasions, the madcap excursions were pushed farther. Angelo mentions a party
of which he had formed a member, when, while crossing Westminster Bridge, the
sight of a boat suggested a fresh act of extravagant frolic, no less than being
rowed to the Tower, taking places, and straightway setting off in the famous hoy
for the sea-trip to Margate, which in those times was quite a journey.</p>

<p>We have already introduced a certain witty and pugilistic divine; let us
avail ourselves of Angelo's remembrances of an incident in his career, the scene
of which belongs to the print we have been endeavouring to elucidate for our
readers. Parson Bate&mdash;better known by this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soubriquet</i> than by his later title as
Sir Bate Dudley&mdash;who was at the time editor of the <cite>Morning Post</cite>, obtained the
nickname of the <cite>Fighting Parson</cite>, from a memorable affray in Vauxhall Gardens.</p>

<p>The particulars of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fracas</i> are thus related in the <span class="locked"><cite>Reminiscences</cite>:&mdash;</span>'Mr.
Parson Bate, as magnificent a piece of humanity, perhaps, as ever walked arm-in-arm
with a fashionable beauty in the illuminated groves of Vauxhall, was
promenading and chatting, with the celebrated Mrs. Hartley,<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> her Woodstock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_161" id="Page_i_161">[161]</a></span>
glove gently rubbing against his sable sleeve; when Mr. Fitzgerald (who was
subsequently hanged in Ireland for certain malpractices), in company with Lord
Littleton and Captain O'Bourne, most ungallantly gave offence to the lady and
her protector by severally turning short round upon her and, with the most
marked rudeness, staring in her face. This offensive behaviour was resented by
Mr. Bate, and, if my memory does not deceive me, he chastised the offenders on
the spot.'</p>

<p>Mr. Bate's paper, <cite>The Morning Post</cite>, obtained much celebrity by the exposure
of the three gentlemen for their rude attack upon a lady. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rencontre</i>
begot a paper war, which was, for some weeks, maintained with great rancour
on both sides; but the superior wit and powerful satire of Parson Bate were so
manifest that his opponents were beaten out of the literary arena.</p>

<p>'Subsequent proceedings led to a meeting of the parties at a tavern, where, it
seems, some explanation was entered into and an apology was offered. This, as
appeared later on, was a discreditable stratagem on the part of the aggressors to
revenge themselves on this redoubtable priest, by procuring for him, as they
anticipated, a sound drubbing; they had, however, once more mistaken their
man.</p>

<p>'These three confederates met according to appointment, and Mr. Bate
brought his friends too. A strapping spark was then introduced to the party as
Captain &mdash;&mdash;, who had been prompted to insult the pugnacious reverend, with
the hope of provoking him to a personal attack, as at Vauxhall. This mock
captain was a well-known prize-fighter. The parson, not at all daunted by the
insolent threats of the ruffian, fell upon him, and with his own weapons, so
completely thrashed him that he was taken away almost senseless in a hackney-coach.'</p>

<p>A farewell incident of Vauxhall, and we will leave for good the precincts
memorable in the history of the past. This time we are carried to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rendezvous</i>
with Angelo and his friends in company with the most incorrigible blades of the
town.</p>

<p>'Lord Barrymore's fondness for eccentricities ever engaged his mind.
Whether in London or Wargrave 'twas all the same&mdash;always in high spirits,
thinking of what fun he should have during the day. Seated, after dinner, at
eleven o'clock, on one of the hottest evenings in July, he proposed that the
whole party should go to Vauxhall.</p>

<p>'The carriage being ordered, it was directly filled inside; and the others outside,
with more wine than wit, made no little noise through the streets.</p>

<p>'We had not been long at Vauxhall when Lord Barrymore called out to a
young clergyman, some little distance from us, who, when he approached and
was asked, "Have you had any supper?" to our surprise answered, "Vy, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_162" id="Page_i_162">[162]</a></span>
how, my lord, I have not as yet had none." A waiter passing by at the time,
Lord Barrymore said, "You know me; let that gentleman have whatever he
calls for;" when he told the parson to fall to, and call for as much arrack punch
as he pleased. "Thank ye, my lord," said he, "for I begins to be hungry, and
I don't care how soon I pecks a bit."</p>

<p>'Lord Barrymore had that morning, unknown to us, contrived to dress Tom
Hooper, the tin-man (one of the first pugilists of that time), as a clergyman, to be
in waiting at Vauxhall, in case we should get into any dispute. This fistic
knight now filled the place of a lackey, and was constantly behind the carriage,
a sworn votary of black eyes and disfigured faces. His black clothes, formal
hat, hair powdered and curled round, so far disguised him that he was unknown
to us all at first, though Hooper's queer dialect must have soon discovered him
to the waiters. This was a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ruse de guerre</i> of Lord Barrymore's. About three
o'clock, whilst at supper, Lord Falkland, Henry Barry, Sir Francis Molineux,
&amp;c., were of our party; there was at this time a continual noise and rioting, and
the arrack punch was beginning to operate.</p>

<p>'On a sudden all were seen running towards the orchestra, the whole garden
seemed to be in confusion, and our party, all impatience, sallied out, those at the
further end of the box walking over the table, kicking down the dishes. It
seems that the effects of the punch had not only got into Hooper's head but
had excited an influence over his fists, for he was for fighting with everybody.
A large ring was made, and, advancing in a boxing attitude, he offered to
fight anyone; but all retired before him. Felix McCarthy, a tall, handsome
Irishman, well known by everybody at that time, soon forced his way through
the crowd and collared him, at the same time saying, "You rascal, you are
Hooper, the boxer; if you do not leave the garden this instant I'll kick you
out." The affrighted crowd, who before retreated as he approached them,
now came forward, when Hooper, finding himself surrounded, and hearing a
general cry of "Kick him out!" made his retreat as fast as possible, thus avoiding
the fury of those who would not have spared him out of the gardens, if he had
been caught. We found him at five in the morning behind Lord Barrymore's
carriage, with the coachman's great-coat on, congratulating himself upon having
avoided the vengeance of those to whom, a short time previously, he had been
an object of fear.'</p>

<p><i>July 24, 1785.</i> <cite>The Slang Society.</cite></p>

<p><i>August 11, 1785.</i> <cite>Introduction.</cite>&mdash;There is hardly sufficient authority to
warrant the editor in directly ascribing this print to Rowlandson; the work
is evidently early, and very French in the characteristics of costumes, surroundings,
and subject. There are points in the etched outline and in the
general spirit and method of execution, which lead to the impression that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_163" id="Page_i_163">[163]</a></span>
Rowlandson is at least answerable for the etching and mezzotinting of the design.
From the costumes worn by the figures the date of the subject may be assumed
to be some time before the French Revolution. An overdressed old abbess, her
head and shoulders enveloped in a cardinal, is introducing a French peer, who is
toothless and decrepit, to a tall and fashionably-attired beauty, who is rising to
receive the visitor with an air of dignified modesty.</p>

the course of his sport, a pretty country maiden, neatly apparelled, and beaming
with all the freshness of rustic simplicity and artlessness. Her budding charms
are tempting the youth to court the maiden, to her own manifest embarrassment;
meanwhile the gay Lothario's huntsman is shown in the distance 'going' off with

</div>

<p>The macaroni Col. Topham, held in leading strings by Henderson and
Mrs. Wells, is vainly trying, armed with a critical squirt, to suppress the
rising celebrity of Holman, the actor, and writer for the stage. Holman, it will
be remembered (see life of Rowlandson), was one of the caricaturist's schoolfellows.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_167" id="Page_i_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p><i>October 5, 1785.</i> <cite>Captain Epilogue.</cite> Republished March 7, 1786, by E.
Jackson, 14 Marylebone Street, Golden Square.&mdash;The figure of Captain Topham,
(afterwards Colonel) of the <cite>World</cite> newspaper, of which he was proprietor, editor,
critic, and scandalmonger&mdash;the fashionable intelligencer, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arbiter elegantiarum</i>, and
man of fashion and gallantry. We find the macaroni soldier and journalist a prominent
personage in the satirical effusions of his time; we recognise him among
Gillray's caricatures as the <cite>Thunderer</cite> (August 20, 1782), and later as the
<cite>Windmill</cite>, standing forth advocating the interests of Mrs. Robinson, the <em>Perdita</em>
who, deserted by the Prince of Wales, found, it was hinted, refuge in the championship
of <em>Captain Epilogue</em>. In another cartoon Major Topham is bringing his
lengthy accounts to Pitt's pay-table, 'for puffs and squibs,' the literary services
which he had placed at the Ministerial disposal, and directed against the Whig
candidate, Lord John Townshend, during the Westminster Election (August 14,
1788), which occurred when Lord Hood was appointed to the Treasury Board.
We find the gallant quill attacking merit where it crossed his partialities, and the
present caricature seems designed to expose the Captain's <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tendresse</i> for the actress
of his choice. Epilogue is dressed, as he is always represented, in the height of
the latest French fashion, his coat, his stockings, his pumps, his frill and ruffles,
and his wig and queue being the very latest importations from Paris; a finger-post
is pointing to the <em>Wells</em>, and the somewhat suggestive and highly modish
figure of the lady is drawn below it.</p>

<p>1785. <cite>A Cully Pillaged.</cite> (Same date as <cite>Comfort in Gout</cite>.)&mdash;A stalwart-looking
bully has suddenly burst into an apartment; he has seized and is
securely holding an alarmed individual, whose hat is thrown off and his wig is
knocked awry; his pigtail is rigid with terror; he is standing on tiptoe, his limbs
paralysed with fear, while a very picturesque-looking Cyprian, with hair and dress
in somewhat dishevelled condition, is deliberately exploring the pockets of the
victim.</p>

<p>1785. <cite>Copper-plate Printers at Work.</cite>&mdash;This sketch, which is vastly interesting,
is probably drawn from the room in which the caricaturist's etchings were
pulled, an apartment evidently near the sky. A couple of stalwart printers are
hard at work rubbing ink into the copper-plates. A sturdy workman is turning
the press, while a little oddity of a printer is drawing an impression from the
copper lately under pressure. A connoisseur, in spectacles, of the old-fashioned
type, is holding up a print at arm's length with a deeply critical expression on
his sharp features. Numerous prints are hung up to dry on lines stretched across
the chamber.</p>

<p><i>About 1785.</i> <cite>A Bed-warmer.</cite>&mdash;Another print, which was published about
this date, bears the name of H. Wigstead as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">delt. et fecit</i>; but, by a strange
anomaly, although a few strokes of the outline here and there belong to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_168" id="Page_i_168">[168]</a></span>
Wigstead's hand, which, from its untutored, straggling style, is easy of recognition,
the figures and filling in are unmistakably by Rowlandson, who has paid
his friend the compliment of ascribing the entire credit of the composition to his
name. The subject represents a bedchamber; clothes, &amp;c., are scattered about
the room; a venerable libertine, whose bed has evidently been recently warmed,
is endeavouring to retain by her skirt a remarkably handsome and sprightly-looking
chambermaid, whose figure is gracefully expressed in Rowlandson's most
felicitous manner, both as regards ease and action. The offended nymph is
making off with the chamber candle and the warming-pan, the latter a formidable
weapon for the defence of assaulted virtue.</p>

<p>1785. <cite>Temptation.</cite>&mdash;A companion plate was executed under the same auspices,
but the name of H. Wigstead in this instance appears as designer only.
It represents a scene of temptation. A decrepit and, as far as years go, venerable
libertine is offering certain proposals to a pretty and finely-shaped maiden, who
is weighing a purse with an air of indecision, while the vicious dotard is pressing
her disengaged hand and leaning on her shoulder. The chamber is evidently
the workroom of a cobbler; his bench and a pile of shoes in the foreground have
been thrown over by the gambols of a dog and cat. In this case it is easy to see
that if the maiden does not retire from the struggle with unstained hands, the
elderly reprobate, whose crutch is under his arm, will not come off unscathed, for
behind the curtains of the bed, in the shadow of the apartment, which seems to
serve as workroom, kitchen, parlour, and bedroom in one, appears the half-concealed
and brawny person of the cobbler himself, who is evidently enjoying the
prospect of the vengeance which he is about to let fall on the head of the old
sinner.</p>

An unfortunate passenger has lost his wig, and in seeking to recover it has
become jammed in the coach-window. The coachman has lost his balance, and
the shock is capsizing his seat; the concussion has discharged the huge blunderbuss
borne by the guard through the letter-bags; the mails, and other contents
are scattered to the winds by the explosion; and, to cap the misfortune, the lurch
has accidentally loosened the trigger of a huge horse-pistol carried in the guard's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_170" id="Page_i_170">[170]</a></span>

by S. W. Fores.&mdash;The studio of an artist, who is somewhat of a macaroni; the
painter is hard at his work; on his easel is a classic subject; the principal figure
is drawn from a pretty girl, his model, who is 'sitting' before him; a squire and
a young foxhunter are dashing in, alike disregardful of the remonstrances of the
artist and the confusion into which their unceremonious entry has thrown his
blushing model, whose nude figure he is endeavouring to block out with his

riders, and secret counsel, at the last moment, is given to jockeys by owners of
horses&mdash;possibly parting instructions to ride either a winning or a losing race, as
their private arrangements may require. That the proceedings of the Turf were
not perfectly pure and above the comment of suspicion in the infancy of horse-racing
is indicated by the caricaturist in the last action of 'jockeyship;' the
riders, while shaking hands finally with their owners and backers, are shown
taking care to keep their left hands open behind their backs for bribes from the
other side; this signal is meeting a golden response. The crowded stand and
the racecourse are sketched in the background.</p>

the artist produced published by J. R. Smith. In the former subject <cite>High Life
Courtship</cite> is represented in the figure of an elegant young noble&mdash;probably meant
for the Prince of Wales&mdash;kneeling at the feet of a graceful and charming young
lady of extreme fashion; the portrait exhibits certain indications of being intended
for that of Mrs. Fitzherbert. There is a great deal of animation and good taste in
the composition. The companion print of <cite>Low Life Courtship</cite> introduces a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_171" id="Page_i_171">[171]</a></span>
British sailor, (who has lost an eye and gained a wooden leg in the service of
his country), pouring out a bumper of spirits and regarding with a longing eye a
careless and semi-intoxicated-looking damsel, who, in spite of evident symptoms
of dissipation, is represented as buxom, fresh-looking, and well-favoured.</p>

<p><i>December 15, 1785.</i> <cite>Rustic Courtship.</cite> Published by J. R. Smith, 83 Oxford
Street. H. Wigstead, del.&mdash;Rowlandson has given his unmistakable characteristics
to this plate, which is executed in outline etching, and filled in in aquatint,
in admirable facsimile of the artist's drawings, washed in Indian ink, and tastefully
coloured. A fair cottage beauty is spinning flax; her wheel is placed outside the
cottage-door; she is being stared at in vacuous admiration by a rustic Colin
Clout, who is grinning from ear to ear and scratching his forehead in perplexity.
Hop-poles are seen in the distance, and the landscape is one of those pretty
country scenes such as may often be seen in England.</p>

<p><i>December 1785.</i> <cite>Filial Affection, or a Trip to Gretna Green.</cite> (Companion
to <a href="#RECONCILIATION"><cite>The Return from Gretna Green, or Reconciliation</cite></a>.)&mdash;This plate, which is
executed in mezzotint, is usually worked up in imitation of a water-colour drawing&mdash;its
resemblance to the original sketch, if judiciously tinted after Rowlandson's
drawing, is sufficiently close to prove deceptive. A post-carriage is tearing
along down hill, on the road to Gretna Green, drawn by four prancing horses,
ridden by a pair of jockeys, and pursued by a posse of mounted horsemen. The
foremost rider, a squire, booted and spurred, is coming close to the elopers and
flourishing his whip revengefully at the occupants of the chaise; his horse is
turned aside by the threatening attitude of the fugitives. The lady, her feathers
flying in the wind, is leaning out of one window, pointing a formidable pistol at
her parent's head; while the dandified young swain who is the abductor in this
case is pointing a second pistol through the other window. The rest of the
chase are lost in the clouds of dust which the wheels of the post-chaise are throwing
in the rear. One venerable gentleman's hat and wig are being left far behind,
like those of our old friend John Gilpin.</p>

by W. Hinton, 5 Sweetings Alley, Royal Exchange.&mdash;The pair of fugitives
we saw in the previous subject are now, like a brace of repentant turtledoves,
returning to the family nest which they had rashly forsaken. The gallant
husband is all submission and civility, pointing to the tears of his bride as
their intercessors to the hearts of the parents. The father is indicating that a
place at his fireside is still the right of his child; the old footman is joyfully
placing a chair for his young mistress; and the servants, introduced in the doorway
of the apartment, are in ecstasies to see the runaway couple return and the
domestic breach happily repaired.</p>

old salt, who is pouring out tea for these degenerate warriors, is regarding their

etched by Rowlandson; published January 5, 1786, by J. R. Smith, 83 Oxford
Street.&mdash;The diversities of character introduced into this drawing, which is one
of Rowlandson's larger productions, entitle it to a prominent place in a collection
of the artist's works. Glimpses of the theatre are seen through the open doors.
In the coloured editions of this plate, which is scarce and valuable, the most
conspicuous figure is that of a military hero, the adventurous Colonel George
Hanger (afterwards Lord Coleraine), companion and instigator of the Prince of
Wales's early frolics; well known to the satirists, and in short one of the
notorieties of his generation. This inveterate 'man about town' is shown with
his invariable companion, christened by the eccentric Colonel, who rejoiced in a
vocabulary of his own, his '<em>Supple-Jack</em>,' a thick stick carried under his arm;
the gallant lounger, who has left the world a volume of eccentric <cite>Memoirs</cite>, with
his <cite>Advice to Lovely Ciprians</cite> by way of Appendix, is lost in admiration of two
highly attractive nymphs, possible members of the 'Sisterhood;' while Georgey
Hanger's truant eyes are engaged in the contemplation of the personal charms
of these butterflies of fashion, the hand of a pickpocket is equally ready to carry
off the Colonel's seals from his fob, as a souvenir of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rencontre</i>. On the right
of the ubiquitous hero another pair of lovely damsels, displaying the follies of the
mode in their attire, are attracting the somewhat marked attentions of a circle
of elderly admirers. A dwarfed and deformed beau, elaborately dressed in the
French fashion, probably designed for the figure of Sir Lumley Skeffington, who
was the authority, among the <em>bucks</em> and '<em>fashionables</em>' of his day, on theatrical
matters, is getting into trouble by the awkwardness into which his near sight
and his gallantry are combining to betray him; the train of an antiquated belle is
coming to grief through the clumsiness of <em>The Skeffington</em>. The lady, whose native
charms, in their decay, are considerably heightened by art, has evidently availed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_182" id="Page_i_182">[182]</a></span>
herself of her fortune to secure a handsome dandified young cavalier; two sturdy
old retired sea captains are contemplating the '<em>Skittish Skeffy</em>,' and his monkey-like
escapades with expressions of profound contempt. A superannuated man
of quality, a venerable <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau</i> of scarecrow aspect, is foppishly cultivating the
good graces of a dashing 'girl of the period;' while two extraordinary Don
Juans, who, judging from their exteriors, would not be suspected of engaging
themselves in amorous intrigues, are enlisting the friendly offices of a comfortable
old body, who unites the twin occupations of selling oranges and play-bills,
with the manipulation of delicate negociations, a recognised and experienced
ambassadress, in fact, to the court of Cytherea, duly credentialised, and, as far
as appearances can be relied on, a thoroughly discreet and capable person in her
profession. A play-bill, adhering to the green-baize-covered walls of the Lobby,
is intended to apply to the situation of the frivolous habitu&eacute;s who are haunting
the crowded lounge&mdash;'<em>The Way of the World</em>,' and '<em>Who's the Dupe?</em>' Beyond
the main groups we have particularised, there are numerous individuals scattered
about, probably well-known characters in their generation, whose persons and
portraits were doubtless familiarly recognised at the date Rowlandson favoured
his contemporaries with this suggestive view of their private amusements in the
<em>Box Lobbies</em>.</p>

tall and graceful female tastefully dressed in white, through a wood; the cavalier
is pointing out the beauties of the scene; the face of a forsaken lady, wearing
a malignant expression, appears from the concealment afforded by the forest
shade.</p>

Europe is pictorially set forth in the fashion of an escutcheon, representing the
two Protestant monarchs under a pavilion, and seated side by side on one throne&mdash;a
Prussian grenadier behind the Great Frederick, and a British sailor behind
George the Third. Frederick is holding the double-headed eagle of Austria in
golden fetters, with his feet on the motto <em>Universal Monarchy</em>. The names of
the various German States, Hanover, Brunswick, Hesse, Saxony, Deuxpont,
and Mayence, are on two shields at the sides of the pavilion. The reigning
Duke of Brunswick, and Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, are standing on either
side of the monarchs in the centre, as supporters, with their hands on their
swords; both are declaring to 'the twin Protestant heroes,' 'When you agree, I
am ready.' The neighbouring States are variously symbolised. The Prince of
Orange is praying for protection; Holland is figured as a milch cow, of which
France is monopolising the produce; and above, a monkey, with the Crown and
Insignia of France, has perched on the globe, and is pointing his claw to Holland.
Busts of the reigning monarchs are ranged around. Denmark 'lays by'
for the present; Sweden is 'in the pay of France;' Portugal is crying, 'Oh!
buy my wine;' Spain wants 'the Rock;' Sardinia is declaring, 'You shall not
settle without me!' The Polish Bear, who is announcing that he 'is not
muzzled,' is standing between Russia and the Sultan of Turkey; the latter is
hurling defiances at Catherine, 'By the great prophet thou art but a woman!'
Russia, as a crowned beast of prey, is 'tortured by ambition, and backed by
Brother Joseph.'</p>

some degree on account of his partial French extraction, and his left-handed
Stuart descent, did not enjoy unmixed popularity, was constantly brought into
ridicule, with which the satirists met his abortive fortification schemes, and a
certain gun, of his own construction, reputed of leather, which it is said he was
anxious to introduce.</p>

<p>The caricaturist has represented the distinguished Master-General of Ordnance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_184" id="Page_i_184">[184]</a></span>
an insipid edition of <cite>Uncle Toby</cite>, as the Duke was frequently nick-named.
The Duke is in his study, fast asleep in his arm-chair, surrounded by his novel
experiments. His foot is resting on the 'Trial of Colonel Debbeig.' A case of
fresh ammunition, in the form of tobacco pipes, is lying by his side, and a number
of rolled up plans of the projected fortifications are thrown about the place. On
the walls are a pair of views on the subject of the proposed fortifications; one
picture represents the bare ground, with labourers and wheel-barrows, and the
skeletons of a projected fleet; the second view gives the fortifications under the
state of their imaginary completion, furnished with guns and ammunition, and
duly manned, with a bulwark of our wooden walls beyond. The solid and
assuring conditions of the preparations on paper are badly sustained in practice.
A pile of card-houses, disposed round the study-table, do duty for fortresses;
broken pipe-bowls and stems take the place of stoneworks and guns. An empty
decanter accounts for the Duke's faith in this imaginary system of protection.
A cat is clawing at the table-cloth, and threatening the total destruction of the
projected defences at one swoop; she is mounted on the muzzle of a sample
gun of the problematical leathern ordnance, of which, rumour asserted, the Duke
of Richmond had ordered a snuff-box maker to supply him patterns. In the
struggles in Parliament, where the Duke's plans were the subject of vexed discussion,
more stress was laid on his political apostasy than upon the inefficiency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_185" id="Page_i_185">[185]</a></span>
of his propositions, patriotism in the senate being subordinated at all times to
the workings of party, and the intrigues for political power.</p>

Grand Seigneur</em>. Published by E. Jackson, 14, Marylebone Street.</p>

<p>The famous Count Boruwloski visited nearly all the courts of Europe,
where he was made the most of on account of his remarkable diminutiveness, as
at the age of twenty his height was but two feet four inches. This Polish
miniature man differed from dwarfs in general, as his figure was well-proportioned,
and he further possessed perfect breeding, was intellectual, good-natured, and
accomplished, and, among other gifts, enjoyed a talent for music, which he had
cultivated. His memoirs, written by himself, first appeared in 1788; he lived to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_187" id="Page_i_187">[187]</a></span>
the advanced age of ninety-eight, he was born at Chaliez, in Russian Poland,
November 1739; he died at Banks' Cottage, near Durham (the gift, it is said,
of some of the prebendaries of Durham Cathedral), September 13, 1837.</p>

<p>The artist, who had an opportunity of studying this duodecimo edition of
humanity from the life, has represented Count Boruwloski in the act of favouring
that mysterious potentate, the Grand Seigneur, with a tune on the violin,
within the sacred and unapproachable precincts (as far as mankind is concerned)
of the harem. The contrast presented between this perfect miniature and the
full-blown and highly developed beauties of the seraglio, the overfed Grand
Turk, and his gigantic guards, is ludicrously marked.</p>

<p><i>May, 1786.</i> <em>A Theatrical Chymist.</em>&mdash;We have already seen the genius of
Holman, who was, as we have noticed, at school with the Caricaturist, rising like
the sun as represented by Rowlandson's pencil and graver: we now find the
satirist giving his alliance to the other side, although the former print, <cite>Topham
endeavouring with his squirt to extinguish the rising genius of Holman</cite>, was being
reissued. Probably the success on one side induced the artist&mdash;who, we presume,
sought only to exercise his art, and was not inconvenienced by party prejudices&mdash;to
try and make as fair a counter-hit as we so often find him doing. The figure
of Holman, a mean and by no means imposing-looking personage, is issuing
from a still, together with a discharge of 'puffs,' &amp;c. The <em>Theatrical Chymist</em>
is a clerical-looking worthy, our old friend Parson Bate, who is employing a
decayed military buck, in tattered regimentals, seated on a pile of paper, to fan
the furnace <em>Academy</em> with the <em>Morning Post</em> bellows; the materials, from
which the actor Holman is being distilled, are <em>Ignorance</em>, <em>Impertinence</em>, <em>Coxcomity</em>,
<em>Misconception</em>, <em>Raving</em>, <em>Ranting</em>, <em>Grinning</em>, <em>Snarling</em>, <em>Tortured Attitudes</em>,
<em>Envy</em>, <em>Detraction</em>.</p>

but it appears some overgrown
and swaggering personage
had constituted himself
the tyrant of the box
lobbies. The old fable of
the Ass in the Lion's skin
is verified. Although a
head and a half taller than
any of those present, the
<em>Branded Bully</em> is allowing
a mere dwarf to pull his
enormous pigtail, and kick
him. The ladies are jeering
at the discomfitted
swaggerer, who, it seems, is
in such abject fear that he
is suffering all sorts of indignities
without attempting
to resent them.</p>

Charlotte is bound to her faithful husband, about whose head is a vision of
antlers. Charlotte is hurried off in despair. As to the hero of the story, he is
writhing about in a passionate paroxysm, a serpent is stinging him, a death's
head looms above his own, the suicide is grasping a pistol in each hand, and
a devil with a scourge of snakes and a vial of poison, is pouring the fatal potion
over his head like Macassar oil, of which his locks, like a Turk's head broom,
standing bolt on end with excitement, do not appear to have any need.</p>

<p>Ursa Major and the General are drawing the elated advocate in a go-cart,
which bears his initial, with a fool's cap worn over an advocate's wig. The
Journalist has bells to his Scotch bonnet, a pen behind his ear, a portrait of
Bruce, his reputed ancestor, round his neck, a rattle is in his hand, while his
publications, <cite>Journal to the Hebrides</cite>, and <cite>Corsica</cite>, are by his side; he is indulging

<p>Bozzy is shown strutting with his short legs very wide apart, posed for the
heroic, with a plaid blowing over his shoulder, a feather in his bonnet, an ink-bottle
at his button-hole, and an advocate's wig and bands: a bulky manuscript,
'Materials for the Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D.,' is serving as his buckler,
and the <em>Journal</em> is flourished as a claymore. <em>Ogden on Prayer</em> is in his pocket.</p>

<p>'I am, I flatter myself, completely a "Citizen of the World." In my travels
through Holland, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Corsica, France, I have never
felt myself from home; and I sincerely love every kindred, and tongue, and
people, and nation'&mdash;(p. 11).</p>

<p>4. <cite>Walking up the High Street, Edinburgh.</cite></p>

<p>'Dr. Johnson and I walked arm in arm up the High Street to my house in

in the morning, having chatted a good while after my wife left us. She had
insisted that, to show all respect to the sage, she would give up our own bedroom
to him, and take a worse. This I cannot but gratefully mention as one of
a thousand obligations which I owe her since that great obligation of her being
pleased to accept of me as her husband.'&mdash;<cite>Vide Journal</cite>, p. 15.</p>

<p>7. <cite>Veronica, a Breakfast Conversation.</cite></p>

<p>'Dr. Johnson was pleased with my daughter Veronica, then a child about
four months old. She had the appearance of listening to him. His motions
seemed to her to be intended for her amusement, and when he stopped she
fluttered, and made a little infantine noise, and a kind of signal for him to begin
again. She would be held close to him, which was a proof, from simple nature,
that his figure was not horrid. Her fondness for him endeared her still more to
me, and I declared she should have five hundred pounds of additional fortune.'&mdash;<cite>Vide
Journal</cite>, p. 17.</p>

<p>8. <cite>Wit and Wisdom making preparations for dinner.</cite></p>

<p>'We gave him as good a dinner as we could. Our Scotch wild-fowl or
grouse were then abundant, and quite in season; and so far as wisdom and wit
can be aided by administering agreeable sensations to the palate, my wife took
care that our great guest should not be deficient.'&mdash;<cite>Vide Journal</cite>, p. 123.</p>

<p>9. <cite>Setting out from Edinburgh on the Tour.</cite></p>

<p>'Wednesday, August 18. On this day we set out from Edinburgh, attended
only by my man, Joseph Ritter, a Bohemian, a fine stately fellow, above six feet
high, who had been over a great part of Europe, and spoke many languages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_195" id="Page_i_195">[195]</a></span>
He was the best servant I ever saw. Let not my readers disdain his introduction,
for Doctor Johnson gave him this character: "Sir, he is a civil man, and
a wise man." My wife did not seem quite easy when we left her, but away we
went.'&mdash;<cite>Vide Journal</cite>, p. 47.</p>

<p>'I bought some speldings, fish salted and dried in a particular manner, being
dipped in the sea and dried in the sun, and eaten by the Scots by way of relish.
He had never seen them, though they are sold in London. I insisted on
Scottifying his palate, but he was very reluctant. With difficulty I prevailed
with him. He did not like it.'&mdash;<cite>Vide Journal</cite>, p. 50.</p>

<p>3. <cite>The Vision at Lord Errol's. Slain's Castle.</cite></p>

<p>'I had an elegant room, but there was a fire in it that blazed; and the sea, to
which my windows looked, roared; and the pillows were made of some seafowls'
feathers, which had to me a disagreeable smell, so that by all these causes I was
kept awake a good time. I saw in imagination Lord Errol's father, Lord
Kilmarnock (who was beheaded on Tower Hill in 1740), and I was somewhat
dreary, but the thought did not last long, and I fell asleep.'&mdash;<cite>Vide Journal</cite>,

<p>4. <cite>Lodging at Mr. M'Queen's, in Glenmorison: the celebrated Spider Scene.</cite></p>

<p>'There were two beds in the room, and a woman's gown was hung on a rope
to make a curtain of separation between them.... Doctor Johnson fell asleep
immediately; I was not so fortunate for a long time. I fancied myself bit by
innumerable vermin under the clothes, and that a spider was travelling from
the wainscot towards my mouth. At last I fell into insensibility.'&mdash;<cite>Vide

<p>5. <cite>Reconciliation at Glenelg, after the Journalist had ridden away from
Ursa Major.</cite></p>

<p>'I resumed the subject of my leaving him on the road, and endeavoured to
defend it better. He was still violent upon that head. I had slept ill; Dr.
Johnson's anger had affected me much. I considered that, without any bad
intention, I might suddenly forfeit his friendship, and was impatient to see him
this morning. I told him how uneasy he had made me by what he had said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_197" id="Page_i_197">[197]</a></span>
He owned he had spoken to me in passion, and that he would not have done
what he had threatened, and added, "Let's think no more on't."&mdash;Boswell: "Well,
then, sir, I shall be easy. Remember, I am to have fair warning in case of any
quarrel. You are never to spring a mine upon me. It was absurd in me to
believe you." Johnson: "You deserved about as much as to believe me from
night to morning."'&mdash;<cite>Vide Journal</cite>, p. 164.</p>

<p>6. <cite>Highland Dance on the top of Dun-Can.</cite></p>

<p>'Old Mr. Malcolm McCleod, who had obligingly promised to accompany
me, was at my bedside between five and six. I sprang up immediately, and
he and I, attended by the two other gentlemen, traversed the country during the
whole of this day. Though we had passed over not less than four-and-twenty
miles of very rugged ground, and had a Highland dance on the top of Dun-Can,
the highest mountain in the island, we returned in the evening not at all
fatigued, and piqued ourselves at not being outdone at the nightly ball by our
less active friends who had remained at home.'&mdash;<cite>Vide Journal</cite>, p. 192.</p>

<p>7. <cite>The Recovery, after a severe drunken frolic at Corrichatachin.</cite></p>

<p>'I awaked at noon, with a severe headache; I was much vexed I should
have been guilty of such a riot, and afraid of a reproof from Dr. Johnson.
About one he came into my room and accosted me, "What, drunk yet!".
When I rose I went into Dr. Johnson's room, and taking up Mrs. McKinnon's
Prayer-book, I opened it at the twentieth Sunday after Trinity, in the Epistle
for which I read: "And be not drunken with wine, wherein there is excess."
Some would have taken this as a divine interposition.'&mdash;<cite>Vide Journal</cite>, p. 318.</p>

<p>8. <cite>Sailing among the Hebrides,&mdash;the Journalist holding a rope's-end.</cite></p>

<p>'As I saw them all busy doing something, I asked Col with much earnestness
what I could do. He with a happy readiness put into my hand a rope
which was fixed to the top of one of the masts, and told me to hold it till he
bid me pull. If I had considered the matter I might have seen that this
could not be of the least service, but his object was to keep me out of the way
of those who were busy working the vessel, and at the same time to divert my
fear by employing me and making me think that I was of use. Thus did I
stand firm to my post, while the wind and the rain beat upon me, always
expecting a call to pull my rope.'&mdash;<cite>Vide Journal</cite>, p. 349.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_198" id="Page_i_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>'The contest began whilst my father was showing him his collection of
medals; and Oliver Cromwell's coin unfortunately introduced Charles the First
and Toryism; in the course of their altercation Whiggism and Presbyterianism,
Toryism and Episcopacy, were terribly buffeted.</p>

<p>'They became exceedingly warm and violent, and I was very much
distressed at being present at such an altercation between two men, both of
whom I reverenced; yet I durst not interfere. It would certainly be very
unbecoming in me to exhibit my honoured father and my respected friend as
intellectual gladiators for the entertainment of the public; and therefore I
suppress what would, I daresay, make an interesting scene in this dramatic
sketch&mdash;this account of the transit of Johnson over the Caledonian hemisphere.'&mdash;<cite>Vide

<p>10. <cite>Imitations at Drury Lane Theatre by the Journalist.</cite></p>

<p>'At Mr. Tyler's I happened to tell that one evening, a great many years ago,
when Dr. Hugh Blair and I were sitting together in the pit of Drury Lane
playhouse, in a wild freak of youthful extravagance I entertained the house
<em>prodigiously</em> by imitating the lowing of a cow. I was so successful in this
boyish frolic that the universal cry of the galleries was, "<em>Encore</em> the cow!
<em>Encore</em> the cow!" In the pride of my heart I attempted imitations of some
other animals, but with very inferior effect. My reverend friend, anxious for
my fame, with an air of the utmost gravity and earnestness addressed me thus:
"My dear sir, I would <em>confine</em> myself to the <em>cow</em>!"</p>

<p>'A little while after I had told this story I differed from Dr. Johnson, I
suppose too confidently, upon some point which I now forget. He did not
spare me. "Nay, sir (said he), if you cannot talk better as a man, I'd have
you bellow like a cow."'</p>

<h2><a name="d1787" id="d1787"></a>1787.</h2>


<p>The authorship of the following pair of prints is doubtful; they present many
indications of Rowlandson's manner, and they were issued by his publisher,
S. W. Fores, 3 Piccadilly; they are sometimes ascribed to <span class="locked">Gillray:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>January 1, 1787.</i> A pair of single figures, respectively described as
<cite>London Refinement</cite> and <cite>Country Simplicity</cite>. As the titles sufficiently indicate,
the former sets forth a town 'macaroni' dressed in the height of the mode,
and the latter represents a pretty youth, of rustic fashion, long-haired, and clad
in picturesque and homely country garb.</p>

<p><i>January 11, 1787.</i> <cite>Uncle George and Black Dick at their New Game
of Naval Shuttlecock.</cite>&mdash;From this caricature it seems that the conduct of the
Admiralty in 1787 gave reasonable grounds for dissatisfaction. The state of things
is pictorially set forth by Rowlandson. In the centre of the picture stand the
compound heads of the Admiralty, a single figure with two fronts&mdash;those of the
King and Lord Howe, who was popularly designated 'The Prince of Duskey
Bay.'</p>

<p>A bevy of admirals are applying to the King for recognition of their
services to their country; they are all partially disabled by the loss of limbs. A
petitioner is offering a statement of their situation to the King, who is made to
declare, 'I never interfere with your First Lord; no, never;' while the second
head of this Janus, Howe, in replying to a petition from sundry aggrieved
captains, is dismissing the applicants with "Go, go! I can do nothing; it is his
Majesty's pleasure that&mdash;&mdash;' The abused admirals are expressing their wrongs:
'I see I shall lose my rank after all my long services!' 'I am set aside, although
I've lost a son and one eye!' 'Humbug'd, by Jove, by ye old Jesuit!' 'Had I
my arm again, to find a better country!' 'Brothers, our Lords and Commons
will not suffer this game!'</p>

<p>The captains have evidently a bad opinion of their First Lord, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vultus est
Index Animi</i>: 'Our navy has now two heads and no helm; rare work!' 'Rascal!'
'The King's pleasure! That's a falsity added to a mean <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">finesse</i>!' 'He's fond
of man&oelig;uvres if ever so bad; you know him!'</p>

<p class="ph4">PETER PINDAR TO THE READER.</p>

<p>Gentle Reader,&mdash;It is necessary to inform thee that his Majesty actually discovered,
some time ago, as he sat at table, a <em>louse</em> on his plate. The emotion occasioned by the
unexpected appearance of such a guest can be better imagined than described.</p>

<p>An edict was, in consequence, passed for shaving the cooks, scullions, &amp;c., and the
unfortunate louse condemned to die.</p>

<p>Such is the foundation of the Lousiad: with what degree of merit the poem is executed,
the <em>uncritical</em> as well as the critical reader will decide.</p>

<p>The ingenious author, who ought to be allowed to know somewhat of the matter, hath
been heard privately to declare, that in his opinion the <cite>Batrachomymachia</cite> of Homer, the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Secchia Rapita</i> of Tassoni, the <cite>Lutrin</cite> of Boileau, the <cite>Dispensary</cite> of Garth, and the <cite>Rape
of the Lock</cite> of Pope, are not to be compared to it,&mdash;and to exclaim at the same time, with
the modest assurance of an author&mdash;</p>

<p>1787. <cite>Transplanting of Teeth.</cite> Published by J. Harris, 37 Dean Street,
Soho.&mdash;Among the schemes of charlatans, which were popularly successful in
the days of <cite>The Temples of Health, Mud Baths</cite>, and other devices by which
pretenders flourished on the gains extorted from fashionable credulity at the end
of the last century, was a new theory of dentistry, according to the practice of
which a sound tooth was to be torn from the jaws of a healthy individual, and,
while still warm, was to be inserted in the gums of some patient whose decayed
molar had been extracted simultaneously, and the rest of the operation was
left to nature. According to the caricaturist, who has produced a large,
spirited, and well-executed plate on this novel operation, we are informed by
advertisement that this truly extraordinary performance is taking place in the
surgery of '<em>Baron Ron, Dentist to her High Mightyness the Empress of Russia</em>,'
The professor has appended to this important announcement the further statement,
'<em>Most money given for Live Teeth</em>.'</p>

<p>The dual operations of depriving the poor of their sound teeth for a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_212" id="Page_i_212">[212]</a></span>
pecuniary consideration, that their lost molars may regarnish the gums of
patients who are prepared to pay for the accommodation, and the substitution of
whole teeth for decayed ones, are proceeding at once. The artist has sketched
two wretched young creatures, in rags, who are stealing out of Baron Ron's
surgery, weeping and bewailing the loss of their teeth, and regarding a coin
held in the palm of their hands, with mourning and reproachful looks. An old
dandy, a military buck, is examining the adjustment of his new teeth, which
do not appear to fit as accurately as could be desired. An assistant dental
professor is planting a live tooth in the gums of a lady of quality, who is
kicking violently, in disapproval of the sensation. An elderly dowager is seated
in suspense in a chair beside a young sweep, whose odoriferous vicinity she is
counteracting by applications to a scent-bottle held to her susceptible nose, while
the Baron&mdash;a modishly costumed foreigner&mdash;is tearing out a beautiful healthy
white tooth from the jaws of the sooty patient, to be straightway transplanted
into the gums of the customer of quality.</p>

old Square-toes.</cite> Engraved by E. Williams; published by J. R. Smith, King
Street, Covent Garden.&mdash;<em>Old Square-toes</em> has called to see his scapegrace&mdash;on
the subject of supplies, it is needless to particularise. Young <em>Hopeful</em>, who
is obviously destined for the Bar&mdash;where, we may feel convinced in advance he
is bound to shine&mdash;has assumed his most specious deportment, and has donned
his cap and gown, with the other semblances of decorum. The title, <em>Fruitless
Attempt</em>, seems somewhat of a misnomer, for the special pleading of young
<em>Hopeful</em> is evidently producing a favourable impression. Old <em>Square-toes</em> has
banged himself down into a chair, and planted his stick on the ground with
an air of determination, in a very square attitude, to demonstrate that his
resolution is not to be shaken, and that young <em>Hopeful</em> is losing his pains; but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_219" id="Page_i_219">[219]</a></span>
as in the old comedies, the paternal heart is yearning towards his progeny,
while his most relentless denunciations are thundered forth; the lines of his
stern face are relaxing, an amused smile is twitching at the corners of his
mouth, and we are convinced that the next remark will embody the sentiments
immortalised by the Georgian dramatists: 'You dog, this time your
father forgives you; boys will be boys; I was a gay young spark myself once;
I'll pay your debts this time, but never again, &amp;c. &amp;c.'</p>

between the two classes of entertainment is pictured with the artist's characteristic
force and spirit. The humour of these two designs is suggestive of
Hogarth's genius. While the woes of 'Romeo and Juliet' are influencing the
spectators to the most profound melancholy, and reducing the audience to tears
and hysteria, the attendants on <em>Comedy</em> are enjoying the humours of the performance
with the most frank and unrestrained merriment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_220" id="Page_i_220">[220]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>1787. <cite><a href="#LOVE">Love in the East</a>.</cite>&mdash;Oriental luxuriousness seems to have had a charm
for Rowlandson's pencil. It is true that the customs of the East were not represented,
at the caricaturist's day, with the strictest adherence to facts; their salient
points have since been made more familiar by the graphic pictures of our
travelled artists, for whom the East has always had a peculiar fascination.</p>

<p>Rowlandson's fancy has supplied those details which he could not furnish
from actual experience, and as far as the general theories of oriental splendour
are concerned, the imaginative delineations of our artist will be found far
more realistic and in accordance with our preconceived impressions than the
actuality.</p>

<p><i>November 5, 1787.</i> <cite>Reformation, or the Wonderful Effects of a Proclamation.</cite>&mdash;The
Chapel Royal is apparently the scene of this subject. King George, Queen
Charlotte, with a Lord and Lady-in-waiting, are in the Royal pew; near them are
the law Lords; the Prince of Wales and Mrs. Fitzherbert, with Col. George
Hanger, are in the centre; Burke is between them, with Lord North, who is of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_221" id="Page_i_221">[221]</a></span>
course represented as sleeping soundly, in spite of the efforts made by a pretty
maiden to awaken him. Pitt is acting as clerk. The sermon is evidently one
of no common significance. Fox is standing in a sheet, with a placard, '<em>For
playing cards on the Lord's Day!</em>' A stout lady, armed with a whip, is driving
a pack of dogs out of the chapel.</p>

(Engraver), 161 Piccadilly. The honours of this plate are, we understand,
divided between Rowlandson and Ramberg. <cite>The Humours of St. Giles's</cite> are
of a diversified nature, as might be supposed. Both artist and engraver seem to
have seized the passing incidents with true Hogarth-like aptitude, and collected
them in one group. There is nothing but the evidence of Rowlandson's peculiarities
to warrant us in including this print among his works. It is very scarce,
and we have not met with his name on any copy of the plate, which is engraved
by T. Harmar, the publisher, after a method bearing some resemblance, as far
as mechanical execution is concerned, to the early style of James Gillray. We
believe the etching is due to Ramberg, but the female figures, and the person
of the hairdresser, are unmistakably characteristic of our artist's manner, both as
concerns expressions and attitudes, and particularly as regards the drawing of
the extremities.</p>

</div>

<p>A 'gin slum' is the centre of attraction; at the sign of the 'Fox and Grapes'
the landlord is serving a buxom and somewhat dishevelled Irish beauty with a
glass of 'blue ruin.' A drunken-looking butcher is standing treat; another fair
member of the hundreds of Drury is entirely overcome, and is a 'deadly lively'
illustration of the usual advertisements traditionally found outside the spirit
cellars of Hogarth's period: 'dead drunk for a penny, clean straw for nothing.'
A dandified French barber, returning from the mansions of his clients in St.
James's, with his powdering-bag and paraphernalia under his arm, is stooping,
from a motive of gallantry, over the semi-conscious nymph, while an urchin is
possessing himself of the tonsor's handkerchief. A baker, taking home ready-cooked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_226" id="Page_i_226">[226]</a></span>
joints to the respective owners, is pausing awhile to enjoy the farces
transacting around him, while the lamplighter, perched on a ladder above to
attend his lamps, is pouring some of his oil over the baked meats by way of
sauce. In the distance is shown an altercation between a milk-maid and a fishfag,
and a bout of fisticuffs is proceeding farther on.</p>

<p><i>March 6, 1788.</i> <cite>The Q. A. loaded with the Spoils of India and Britain.</cite>&mdash;The
Q. A. is a zebra; Pitt is seated, with well-stuffed panniers, in front of this
novel steed, loaded with costly spoils, <em>Rights and Wrongs</em>; round the Zebra's
neck is a bag of <em>Bulse</em>, containing some of Warren Hasting's famous ill-gotten
diamonds. Pitt is sharply whipping his beast, and declaring 'I have thrown off
the mask, I can blind the people no longer, and must now carry everything by
my bought majority.' The Q. A. is also trumpeting forth, 'What are children's
rights to ambition? I will rule in spite of them, if I can conceal things at Q.' A
law lord, said to be intended for Lord Thurlow, who has hold of the animal's
head, is filled with certain gloomy apprehensions: 'So many Scotchmen have
left their heads behind in this d&mdash;d town for treason, I begin to tremble as much
as the thief in the rear for my own.' The thief in the rear is the Duke of Richmond,
who, with one of his famous defence guns between his legs, is assisting
Pitt's advance with a goad, and crying 'Skulking in the rear, out of sight, suits
best my character.' A finger-post is pointing to <em>Tower Hill</em>, by <em>B&mdash;m (Buckingham)
House</em>.</p>

<p>James Dunthorne seems to have had a taste for inventing symbolical renderings
of human infirmities; in the present case the two conditions of <cite>Ague and Fever</cite>
are at least ingeniously portrayed. The cold snake-like folds of <em>Ague</em> are
twining round the shivering victim, seated as he is in the full heat of a blazing
fire; while the quivering heats of <em>Fever</em> personified are in attendance, between
the patient and his physician, waiting to add his persecutions to the infirmities
which the sick man is already enduring.</p>

at Kensington before their Majesties.</cite> Published by William Holland, 50 Oxford
Street.&mdash;This print, with a crowd of others on the same incident, had its rise in
an accident: the Prince of Wales, being out driving in a curricle with Mrs. Fitzherbert,
by some misadventure was thrown from his vehicle, and his companion
shared his fall. In Rowlandson's print the Prince has fallen on his back, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_228" id="Page_i_228">[228]</a></span>
the lady is taking a Phaeton-like flight on to his body. The positions are reversed
in the caricatures Gillray and other satirists produced on the subject. George
the Third and his Queen, with an escort of Guards, are riding past at the very
moment, and they seem greatly interested in the spectacle of their son's downfall.</p>

<p><i>July 22, 1788.</i> <cite>Old Cantwell Canvassing for Lord Janus.</cite>&mdash;The Westminster
Election again created further excitement in 1788, as the old field on
which the Whigs had gained their triumph against Court interest. The appointment
of Lord Hood, in the beginning of July, to a seat at the Admiralty
Board rendered a new election necessary. Hood, as the supporter of Pitt, enjoyed
the advantage of the Ministerial assistance; the Opposition, however,
contested the seat so efficiently in favour of Lord John Townshend, in the Whig
interest, that, in spite of the man&oelig;uvres of the Ministry, the Liberal member was
returned.</p>

<p>In Rowlandson's print a Methodistical congregation is being harangued by
the pastor on the respective qualities of the candidates. Lord Hood, whose
countenance is wearing a look of sanctified horror, is accommodated with a seat
behind his advocate; and a sailor, with a bludgeon and the union-jack unfurled,
is also in the pulpit. <em>Old Cantwell</em> has a work in his hand setting forth representations
of <em>Devil Townshend</em> and <em>Saint Hood</em>. The eloquence of the
preacher is directed against the failings of his opponents: 'Lord Hood is a
saint, my dear brethren, as immaculate as a newborn babe; but as for Lord
Townshend, he'll be <span class="locked">d&mdash;&mdash;</span>d to all eternity. I shudder when I tell you he loves
a pretty girl; the Opposition to a man are all fond of pretty girls! They go
about like lions in pursuit of your wives and daughters. Lord Hood's pious
Committee will swear to it,' &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>July 27, 1788.</i> <cite>Effects of the Ninth Day's Express from Covent Garden, just
arrived at Cheltenham.</cite>&mdash;The King had retired to Cheltenham, where, according
to the artist, he was taking the waters with his family; a postilion has arrived
express from London with the latest intelligence concerning the election for
Westminster. The 'result of the ninth day's poll&mdash;majority for Lord John Townshend,
218,' is too much for his Majesty, who is quite overcome; he has dropped
the tumbler from which he was taking the waters, and has fallen into the arms
of a page; a peasant, who has been drawing the water for his sovereign, is, in
consternation, deluging the royal shoe with a few quarts of the same fluid;
Queen Charlotte is horrified, and the pretty Princesses are clasping their hands
in consternation. In Court circles it was represented that the Whigs were
capable of any atrocity, however deep.</p>

<p><i>August 1, 1788.</i> <cite>The School for Scandal.</cite> Published by V. M. Picot, 6
Greek Street, Soho. T. Rowlandson, invt.; V. M. Picot, direxit.&mdash;One of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_229" id="Page_i_229">[229]</a></span>
long strips containing subjects arranged in series, which were popular at this
period, belonging to the same order as <em>The Bath Minuet</em> and <em>The Progress of a
Lie</em>, by H. Bunbury; <em>A Country Dance</em> and <em>A Cotillon</em>, by W. H. Kingsbury;
<em>The Installation Supper, as given at the Pantheon, by the Knights of the Bath</em>
(on May 26, 1788), by James Gillray; <em>The Prince's Bow</em>, by F. G. Byron;
<em>English Slavery, or a Picture of the Times</em>, 1788; <em>Chesterfield Travestied</em>, by
Collings, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p><cite>The School for Scandal</cite> consists of seventeen females, of ages varying from
a tender maid to an antiquated grandmother; the respective characteristics of
the different individuals are hit off with Rowlandson's usual spirit and success;
the pretty maidens being extremely flattered, and the traits of less favoured
dowagers coming in for grotesque exaggerations. The fair members of this
coterie are supposed to be making their several comments, as exclamations, upon
a recent elopement, a proceeding not unusual at the time <em>The School for
Scandal</em> was given to the public: 'Off! positively off!' 'I'm thunderstruck!'
'Poor creature, I pity her!' 'And with a low-bred fellow!' 'Did you expect
anything else?' 'A footman too!' 'Even so!' 'Mind, it's a secret!' 'Not a
syllable!' 'Poor as we are, my daughter would not have done so!' 'I! God
forbid!' 'Oh! 'tis fashionable life!' 'She vow'd she'd go!' 'So fine a girl! with
so good a fortune!' 'I say nothing!' 'An ill-made scoundrel too!' 'He's good
enough for her!'</p>

<p><i>November 25, 1788.</i> <cite>Filial Piety.</cite> Published by S. W. Fores, 3 Piccadilly.&mdash;The
King's illness gave serious grounds for apprehension; as his chances of
recovery became more precarious the Tories thought fit to insinuate that the
Prince and his adherents were awaiting the royal dissolution with ill-concealed
satisfaction. In <em>Filial Piety</em> we find the King almost at his last gasp; he is
stretched on the bed, from which, it was generally concluded, he would never
be able to get up; his hand is raised to his head in token of suffering, and he
is turning away his face from a spectacle well calculated to disturb the last
moments of a pious and suffering parent. The Prince and his friends have just
risen from a drunken bout; their spirits have evidently been well sustained; the
Heir Apparent is reeling in, with 'Damme, come along; I'll see if the old fellow's
---- or not?' Georgey Hanger has come dancing in to support his comrade;
under his arm is his <em>Knock-me-down Supple-Jack</em>, and he has a bottle held in
readiness for emergencies. Sheridan, who became prominent at this period as
the Prince's confidential adviser, is capering and huzzaing. A table is knocked
over, and the Sacrament is thrown on the ground; a bishop on his knees, who is
offering a prayer for the <em>Restoration of Health</em>, is horrified at the scandalous
improprieties committed by these boisterous intruders. On the wall is a representation
of the <em>Prodigal Son</em>, as appropriate to the occasion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_230" id="Page_i_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p><i>December 26, 1788.</i> <cite>The Prospect before us.</cite>&mdash;Although the satirists took
some pains to point out the aspirations of the Whigs, they did not conceal their
sympathies for the position of the Prince, and the necessity of providing for the
security of his interests in the future, as threatened by the Regency restrictions.
<em>The Prospect before us</em>, at the end of 1788, seemed likely to be shortly realised,
until the unexpected recovery of the King put an end to the hopes and intrigues
of both parties. The prospect which threatened the hopes of the Prince and his
Whig adherents was the practical investment of the sovereign power in the
hands of the Queen and Pitt, to the setting aside of the Prince's influence save
in name. The crown is divided; one-half is wavering over the head of Pitt, and
the other is suspended over the head of the Queen, who is trampling on the
coronet and triple plume of the Heir Apparent, 'my son's right.' Queen Charlotte
is held by the Minister in leading-strings. Pitt, who had suffered his zeal to
outrun his discretion, is understood to have made a statement, in the heat of
debate, which his opponents characterised as downright treason; the questionable
expression,<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> with some additional colouring, is set down in a written speech
which he is displaying in his hand: '<em>I think myself as much entitled to be Regent
as the Prince of Wales.</em>' Pitt, under the shelter of the Queen, is declaring:
'Behind this petticoat battery, with the assistance of <em>Uncle Toby</em> (Duke of
Richmond), I shall beat down the legal fortifications of this isle and secure the
Treasury at the next general election!' Queen Charlotte is holding a draft of
special <em>Taxes, 1789, by Billy's desire</em>. <em>Petticoats, Blue and Buff Cloth; Devonshire-Brown
Silk, Portland Stone, Fox Muffs</em>. The bulky form of Madame
Schwellenberg, Mistress of the Robes&mdash;the German favourite of the Queen and the
popular detestation of the rest of the community&mdash;is swaggering along to the
House of Lords, with the Mace and Purse; she has supplanted Thurlow as Lord
Chancellor, and is already dictating the policy her mistress is to follow: 'Take
care to secure the jewels; I have hitherto been confined to the wardrobe, but now
mean to preside at the Council, and, with Billy's assistance, the name of Schwellenberg
shall be trumpeted to the remotest corner of Rag Fair.' The Queen is
proclaiming herself a passive agent: 'I know nothing of the matter. I follow
Billy's advice!'</p>

<p>The Treasury gates are securely closed; the spectators are declaring that the
Premier, Pitt, 'never meddled with a petticoat before;' and Warren Hastings is
observing with delight that his apprehensions concerning the action of his
enemies are at an end, and that the influence he had made with the Queen, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_231" id="Page_i_231">[231]</a></span>
the form of gifts of jewels, is now likely to become of service: 'My diamonds
will now befriend me. Huzza!'</p>

<p><i>December 1788.</i> <cite>The English Address.</cite>&mdash;To this further satire upon the
<em>Regency Restrictions</em> Rowlandson has attached the name of H. Wigstead. Pitt
is standing on a platform receiving the congratulations of a drove of donkeys.
The Prince of Wales, wearing his coronet, plume, and broad riband, is held in
fetters, a powerless victim in the hands of 'the Pitt party.' The Duke of Richmond
has secured one end of the chain; on the reputation of his abortive fortification
propositions he declares, while alluding to the lean figure of his leader,
'Billy's virtue is bomb-proof, gentlemen; he is well fortified in his own good
works.' Both the personal peculiarities of the Prime Minister and his attitude
are well hit off; he is giving his followers this assurance: 'Gentlemen, I have
chained up your Prince; your enemies may insult him as they please; he cannot
resent it. I expect to receive all your thanks for this service I have done your
Constitution. Should a war break out you have how nobody to defend you&mdash;look
upon me, gentlemen, as your saviour; I will only tax you a little more, and
quarter a few more of my needy relations on you, and will then retire to my new
office of Treasurer and Secretary, at Buckingham House.' For these patriotic
services the members of the asinine assembly are duly acknowledging their
gratitude.</p>

<p><i>December 26, 1788.</i> <cite>The Political Hydra.</cite>&mdash;Fox, in this case, enjoys the
distinction of having his career pictorially illustrated in six phases: <em>Out of place,
and in character</em>; black-bearded and swarthy, his rugged locks unkempt. <em>In place;
out of character</em>; his beard shaven, his locks powdered. <em>As he might have been</em>;
crowned with the cap of Liberty. <em>As he would have been</em>; wearing a coronet.
<em>As he should have been</em>; his head severed by the executioner's axe, the punishment
awarded traitors. <em>As he will be</em>; enjoying the supreme power under the Prince
of Wales's diadem. This last prophecy was premature, as was soon seen.</p>

<p><i>December 29, 1788.</i> <cite>A Touch on the Times.</cite>&mdash;Rowlandson has taken his own
print of the <em>Times</em>, 1784, and has produced a parody upon the same theme. In
this case the Prince is again represented as being led to the steps of the throne;
one foot is placed on a solid base, the <em>Voice of the People</em>; the second step, however,
<em>Public Safety</em>, is sadly injured; <em>Virtue</em>, as indicated on the throne, is a
money-bag; the coming ruler is making patriotic professions: 'I would do the
best to please my people.'</p>

<p>Fox is leaning on the throne; his figure is intended to personify that of
<em>Justice</em>; a brace of dice-boxes form the new scales of Justice, a bludgeon, topped
with an eye, is <em>the Sword of Justice</em>. Fox is declaring: 'I have the voice of the
people in my eye.' Sheridan is playing the part of <em>Liberty out at elbows</em>; while
leading the Prince to the throne he is picking his pockets. <em>Britannia</em> is showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_232" id="Page_i_232">[232]</a></span>
a cloven foot; Pitt, provided with a huge extinguisher, is stumbling over the
<em>British Lion</em>; he is boasting, in reference to the incendiary torches of <em>Envy,
Rebellion, &amp;c.</em>, which sundry Furies are flourishing around, 'I could soon extinguish
these puppet-show vapours, if properly supported.' The City Corporation
has sent its deputies, as in the former print; their complaint is, 'We have
not been taxed this twelvemonth!' <em>Commerce</em> in this instance is depicted as a
dissolute harridan, deep sunk in gin.</p>

<p><i>December 30, 1788.</i> <cite>Sir Jeffery Dunstan Presenting an Address from the
Corporation of Garratt.</cite>&mdash;Pitt is crowned; his throne is not, however, exactly a
seat of dignity; his secretary, Dr. Prettyman, Bishop of Lincoln, is holding an
<em>Address from Manchester</em>.</p>

<p>Sir Jeffery Dunstan, a poor deformed, half-witted, and 'eccentric character' of
the time, has shouldered the civic mace, and is presenting an address from the
very ancient and respectable Corporation of Garratt, beginning: 'High and
mighty Sir.' Pitt is replying: 'Thanks, thanks, my respectable friend; this is
the most delicious cordial I have tasted yet.' Brook Watson, Alderman Wilkes,
and others are supporting the address. A tomfool, who, as trainbearer, has
hold of Sir Jeffery's cloak, is enquiring, 'Did you ever see such grace and
dignity in your life, Mr. Alderman?' To which Wilkes is responding, 'Grace&mdash;he
shall be made Master of the Ceremonies at St. James's!'</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Advertisement Extraordinary.</span>&mdash;This is to inform the public that this extraordinary
phenomenon is just arrived from the Continent, and exhibits every day during the
sittings of the House of Commons before a select company. To give a complete
detail of his wonderful talents would far exceed the bounds of an advertisement, as
indeed they surpass the powers of description. He eats single words and evacuates
them so as to have a contrary meaning. For example, the word Treason he can
make Reason, and of Reason he can make Treason; he can also eat whole sentences,
and will again produce them either with a double, different, or contrary meaning, and
is equally capable of performing the same operation on the largest volumes and
libraries. He purposes, in the course of a few months, to exhibit in public for the
benefit and amusement of the Electors of Westminster, when he will convince his
friends of his great abilities in this new art, and will provide himself with weighty
arguments for his enemies.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p></div>

<p>The hero of this specious advertisement is Fox; he is standing near the
Speaker's table, in the House of Commons, where the members are struck with
amazement at his dexterity in this novel accomplishment. In one hand the
Whig performer is holding out his speech on the <em>Rights of the Prince</em>, and the
<em>Explanation of that Speech</em> in the other. 'All these,' he declares, 'I will devour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_233" id="Page_i_233">[233]</a></span>
next.' Two important and bulky works are at his feet, waiting their turn to be
devoured&mdash;<em>Jus Divinum of Kings</em> and <em>Principles of Toryism</em>. On the table,
placed before the 'Word-Eater,' is a provision of considerable substance which will
test his further powers of digestion&mdash;<em>Statutes at Large</em>, <em>Magna Charta</em>, <em>Principles
of the Constitution</em>, and <em>Rights of the People</em>.</p>

<p><i>December 31, 1788.</i> <cite>Blue and Buff Loyalty.</cite>&mdash;The sympathy openly manifested
by the Whig faction for the Prince's prospects of succeeding to power is
satirised at the expense of <em>Blue and Buff</em> susceptibilities. <em>Saturday.</em>&mdash;The
Royal Physician is drawn looking very downcast, with his gold-headed cane to his
lips. 'Doctor: How is your patient to-day?'&mdash;'Rather worse, sir.' <em>Blue and
Buff Loyalty</em> is made to exult somewhat indecorously: 'Ha, ha! rare news!'
<em>Sunday.</em>&mdash;'Doctor: How is your patient to-day?' The physician's face expresses
restored confidence: 'Better, thank God!' An expression the reverse of loyal

it is truly a moment of suspense. Whether the horse-pistols of the burglars will
miss fire, and the formidable blunderbuss held by the respectable householder
will lodge its contents&mdash;which would be, seemingly, enough to mow down a
regiment&mdash;in the dastardly bodies of the midnight marauders, must remain a
problem, the solution of which is lost beyond recovery.</p>

</div>

<p>1788. <cite><a href="#LOVE_DUST">Love and Dust</a>.</cite>&mdash;Cinder-sifters pursuing their grimy avocation somewhere
in the outskirts, in the neighbourhoods where the great pyramidal heaps of
dust and cinders were to be found in the last century. That romance should soften
the front of labour, and that <em>Black Sal</em> and <em>Dusty Bob</em> should lighten the sifting
of cinders with a mixture of conviviality and flirtation, is but another proof that
human nature is everywhere constituted on the same susceptible principles&mdash;a
fact open to demonstration. The present print, which, in its way, is about as
terrible in its vagabond fidelity and grim humour as anything which Rowlandson
has left us, has been included in the present series, with a due sense of editorial
responsibility, as affording a fair instance of our caricaturist's talent in Hogarth's
realistic walk.</p>

<p>To draw this and similar groups from the life, Rowlandson had only to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_236" id="Page_i_236">[236]</a></span>
a stroll from Soho to the corner where the Gray's Inn Road now stands. On
the ground which Argyle Street, Liverpool Street, and Manchester Street at
present occupy, in the caricaturist's day was spread 'that sublime, sifted
wonder of cockneys, the cloud-kissing dust-heap, which sold for twenty thousand
pounds.'</p>

<p>The sum quoted is apocryphal; but it is known that, by some chance, Russia
heard of these famous accumulations of dust and cinders&mdash;said to have been
existing on the same spot since the Great Fire of London&mdash;and, as the fallen
city of Moscow required rebuilding after Napoleon's famous Russian campaign,
the government of the Czar purchased the vast piles and shipped them to
Moscow.</p>

<p>This estate&mdash;the site of the ground on which the dust-heap stood&mdash;was
purchased by the 'Pandemonium Company' in 1826, for fifteen thousand pounds.
The Liverpool Street Theatre was erected, and the surrounding grounds subsequently
let on building leases. Beyond the Gray's Inn Road heap&mdash;when the
Caledonian Road was a rural thoroughfare&mdash;was the Battle-Bridge Estate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_237" id="Page_i_237">[237]</a></span>
some twenty acres, described in the 'New Monthly Magazine' (1833) as 'the
grand centre of dustmen, scavengers, horse and dog dealers, knackermen, brickmakers,
and other low but necessary professionalists.' As Mr. T. C. Noble&mdash;the
descendant of the original lucky speculator who secured the dustheap, and
sixteen dilapidated tenements, as he relates, for about 500<i>l.</i>&mdash;communicated to
Pink's <cite>History of Clerkenwell</cite>, 'the site of the mountain of cinders is now covered
by the houses of Derby Street; the names of the thoroughfares erected on this
estate were derived from the popular ministers of that day.'</p>

<p>1788. <cite><a href="#FENCING">A Fencing Match</a>.</cite>&mdash;Rowlandson was an amateur, as we have noticed,
of all manly exercises. In his day riding, boxing,<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and especially fencing, were
considered indispensable accomplishments for the man of 'ton.' We have had
occasion to allude to our artist's intimacy with Angelo, the fashionable professor
of sword exercises, who notices the caricaturist's works with appreciation, and
mentions him with the highest personal esteem, in various passages of his
memoirs and anecdotes. Rowley executed numerous sketches for his friend
Angelo; and he further engraved a series of plates for him, besides a large and
interesting view of his fencing-rooms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_241" id="Page_i_241">[241]</a></span></p>
<p>The present subject, which is particularly excellent as regards grouping and
execution, probably represents an encounter at Angelo's rooms, either in the
West or in the City, in both of which parts of town he held establishments. The
principal figures, and the personages grouped around the fencers, were no doubt
meant to designate portraits; but as no evidence has been preserved to this date
that would assist in more than a partial identification of one or two professional
celebrities, it is nearly impossible to recognise the major part of the individuals
present.</p>

<h2><a name="d1789" id="d1789"></a>1789.</h2>


<p>Several of the prints included under our description of the political caricatures
for 1789 are confessedly of somewhat doubtful parentage. In one or two
cases, other artists, like Kingsbury, are entitled to the credit of having a share
in the prints we here include with Rowlandson's works.</p>

<p>After carefully examining and comparing the questionable plates with those
whose authenticity is certain, we have selected only such examples as we feel
convinced are not altogether out of place in this volume, while we acknowledge
a doubt of their precise authenticity. It is the old story of the engraver with
more than one publisher disguising his handiwork, as Gillray and other caricaturists
are well known to have done, to accommodate rival print-selling firms,
without appearing to depart from the loyalty due to their principal employer. In
the case of Gillray, it will be remembered, his allegiance was enlisted, and in a
more special manner than is usual in the relation between artist and publisher,
in the interests of the Humphreys. In the instance of Rowlandson, although he
did not supply any one firm with his works, to the exclusion of other publishers, at
the period we are describing&mdash;and before either Mr. Ackermann, of the Strand,
took our artist under his protecting care, or Mr. Tegg, of Cheapside, began to
pour his cheaper caricatures into the market&mdash;it will be recognised that Rowlandson's
best prints were issued by Mr. S. W. Fores, of Piccadilly. He occasionally,
when a popular subject gave unusual impulse to the demand for satirical plates,
supplied Mr. W. Holland of Oxford Street with his etchings, slightly varying
his style as far as the manipulative portion of the engraving was concerned,
but retaining all the more special features of his identity. Indeed it is doubtful
if he sought to disguise his handiwork in the sense adopted by Gillray, who did
not hesitate, it has been said, to produce inferior piracies, executed by his own
hand, with intentional clumsiness and apparently defective skill, after his own
masterpieces, to accommodate caricature-sellers who wished to secure his works
otherwise than through the legitimate channel of his own publishers, who are
known to have been both respectable and liberal in their dealings with this
wayward and unscrupulous genius.</p>

<p><i>January 1, 1789.</i> <cite>The Vice <span class="locked">Q&mdash;&mdash;</span>'s Delivery at the Old Soldier's Hospital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_243" id="Page_i_243">[243]</a></span>
in Dublin.</cite>&mdash;Published in Dublin; republished by W. Holland, 50 Oxford Street.&mdash;This
print alludes to a certain interesting event. The Lord Lieutenant's
lady has apparently been confined in a ward of the Soldier's Hospital, Dublin.
One old veteran, who is nursing the bold young stranger, is declaring: 'Deel,
my saul, but he'll be a brave soldier.' The distinguished parent is responding:
'Thanks, thanks, my brave sergeant, you shall be knighted this day.'
Soldier's porridge is supplied, as a substitute for caudle. An invalided
warrior is inclined to quarrel with this proceeding: 'Downright robbery, by
St. Patrick! We'll soon be famished if our broth is to be stole from us in this
manner.'</p>

<p><i>January 8, 1789.</i> <cite>The modern Egbert, or the King of Kings.</cite>&mdash;The Prince of
Wales is pictured in the position of Egbert when towed by kings on the river. The
vexed question of the '<em>Regency Restrictions</em>' is still the difficulty of the situation.
His Royal Highness is held captive; his hands and feet are bound in golden
chains. The arms of the <em>Stork and Anchor</em>, as hung out upon Pitt's barge, are
placed above the <em>Royal Standard of England</em>. The modern Egbert, while passing
St. Stephen's, is declaring, in reference to his fettered condition, 'I feel not for
myself but for my country.' Pitt, wearing the dress in which he is usually
represented&mdash;the Windsor uniform&mdash;and with an imperial diadem placed upon
his head, is acting as steersman to his barge, which carries a huge flag inscribed
with his arms, and the words '<em>Devil take right, P. W.</em>' The young statesman
is encouraging his crew to 'pull together, boys!' The four oarsmen are all
crowned as kings. Thurlow the Thunderer, with his diadem perched above
his chancellor's wig, is acting as stroke, and pulling away vengefully: 'Damme,
I've got precedence of the young lion!' The Marquis of Buckingham is
asserting, 'I'll answer for the Shillalagh without authority!' Dundas is rowing
with a long golden spoon; he is declaring, 'The prince shall remember old
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nemo Impune</i>;' and the Duke of Richmond, with one of his famous guns as an
oar, is promising 'We'll show him Gallic faith!'</p>

<p>1789. <cite>The Pittfall.</cite>&mdash;The chance of catching the Crown&mdash;in the print a
kind of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ignis fatuus</i>, has lured Pitt and the parliamentary allies (who supported
his measures for 'restricting the powers of the Regent') to the brink of destruction.
The Pittfall is nothing less than the infernal regions, pictorially set
forth as smoke, and a great deal of flame, with fantastic devils, furies and pitchforks,
all seething together. Pitt is making a flying leap to seize the Crown,
which is fluttering above his reach: 'I'll have thee or perish in the attempt, for
my ambition knows no bounds!' The leading demon is prepared with a barbed
prong, to receive the Minister on his descent below, while offering Pitt the
comforting assurance: 'You will be elected Regent in our dominions <em>nem. con.</em>'
The Duke of Richmond has overstepped the margin, and is plunging headlong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_244" id="Page_i_244">[244]</a></span>
into the clutches of his tormentors. 'Spare me this time,' he cries; adding, with
a liberality little likely to be appreciated in the quarter to which it is addressed,
'and you shall have coal in future without duty.' A friend is assuring the Duke,
in allusion to his left-handed descent from Charles the Second, 'All your great
grandfather's <span class="locked">w&mdash;&mdash;s</span> are waiting dinner for you!'</p>

<p>Thurlow is hurling at the flitting diadem with the Chancellor's mace. He is
proclaiming his resolution with a strong asseveration, 'I'll have a knock at it!'
The Duke of Grafton also descended, it will be remembered, from the 'Merry
Monarch,' is declaring, 'Junius has lamed me, or I'd have a knock at it too!'</p>

<p><i>January 30, 1789.</i> <cite>The Propagation of a Truth.</cite> H. W. invt. Published
by Holland, Oxford Street.&mdash;Bunbury's long serial slip, '<cite>The Propagation of
a Lie</cite>,' enjoyed a wide reputation. In the present print Rowlandson, under the
suggestion of his friend Wigstead, has turned the social satire to political
purposes. The Tory chances seemed utterly forlorn at the time of the King's
illness; indeed, the loss of their offices was only a question of days, until an
unexpected change in the royal health cleared off their apprehensions. At the
beginning of the year 1789, however, no one doubted that a week or two would
see Fox and the Whigs back in power. In the <em>Propagation of a Truth</em> the
members of the threatened Ministry are represented as imparting their personal
apprehensions to one another confidentially. <span class="locked"><em>R&mdash;&mdash;e</em></span> <em>(Rose)</em>, one of the
Treasury Secretaries, is rushing in with this gloomy intelligence: 'The people
refuse to address.' The profane Thurlow is invoking objurgations upon the
optics of the public. Pitt is collapsing: 'Then I am done up!' Lord Sidney
is declaring: 'It is all dickey with me!' Dundas is stamping with vexation:
'I'll gang to my own country, and sell butter and brimstone!' The Duke of
Richmond is admitting his fears: 'I begin to smell powder;' and the Duke of
Grafton is corroborating his colleague's theory. Lord Chatham, at the Admiralty,
is asserting: 'I thought myself snug.' Lord Camden confesses, from his
experience, 'I should have known better.' Brook Watson, with his wooden leg,
is saying: 'I cannot Brook this, I'll hop off!' Grenville, who occupied the
Speaker's chair (January 5 to May), does not relish losing his new wig. Old
Alderman Wilkes, who had ratted extensively in his time, and who was, at the
date of the present caricature, slyly paying his court to both sides simultaneously,
is congratulating himself upon the famous squint immortalised by Hogarth:
'I can look either way!' Lord Carmarthen is uncomfortable: 'I've been
in anguish all night!'</p>

<p>Both factions of Tories and Whigs alike were satirised alternately. If one
print was severe on the Ministry and their adherents, it was certain to be followed
in turn by no less cutting strictures upon their antagonists of the Opposition.</p>

<p><i>January 21, 1789.</i> <cite>Loose Principles.</cite> Published by S. W. Fores, 3 Piccadilly.&mdash;Fox
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_245" id="Page_i_245">[245]</a></span>
is represented in his study; the busts of Wat Tyler and Jack
Cade are its ornaments. His book shelves offer '<em>The Laws of Pharaoh</em>,' '<em>Political
Prints</em>,' '<em>Life of Oliver Cromwell</em>,' '<em>Cataline</em>,' '<em>Memoirs of Sam House</em>,' and
kindred literature. Fox is plunged in distress; Burke is engaged in a certain
quest; 'not searching for precedents, but consequences.' Sheridan&mdash;whose foot is
standing on a volume of Congreve's plays, marked '<em>School for Scandal</em>,' indicating
that this comedy was somewhat of a plagiarism from the works of his predecessor&mdash;has
charge of the Regent's clyster-pipe, his confidential appointment being that
of 'Principal Promoter of Loose Principles.'</p>

<p><i>January 28, 1789.</i> <cite>Suitable Restrictions.</cite> Published by S. W. Fores, 3 Piccadilly.&mdash;The
Heir Apparent, according to this print, is treated as an infant.
A long pinafore, and a child's cap, are employed to carry out the theory of his
puerility. Pitt, in court dress, is making sure of his ward, for he is holding him
in leading-strings. Pitt's <em>restrictions</em> effectually prevent the Prince from stooping
to take up the Crown, which is the subject of a new game of ring-tor. The
leading Whigs, shown kneeling down at a little distance, are taking part in the
sport. Fox is making a shot at the ring, in the centre of which stands the
Crown of England: 'My game for a crown!' Sheridan's chief anxiety is for
his own interests: 'Knuckle down, and don't funk, Charley.' Burke, who is
eager to take his chance, is exclaiming: 'My turn next, Sherry!'</p>

<p><i>January 30, 1789.</i> <cite>Neddy's Black Box, containing what he does not value
three skips of a louse.</cite> Published by S. W. Fores.&mdash;The Prince appears on his
throne, a full-fledged Regent by anticipation, with all his plumes and paraphernalia.
The ex-patriot Burke is kneeling in an attitude of courtier-like
servility, and presenting the head of Charles the First, preserved in the
<em>Treasury Box</em>: 'My Liege, I told them in the House no day so proper to
settle the Regency as Charles's martyrdom.' Sheridan, who wears the blue
and buff uniform like his colleague, is supporting the orator: 'I, too, am for
despatch; such days best suit our purpose.' From Sherry's pocket is peeping
the pamphlet, '<em>Horne Tooke's Letter on the Prince's Marriage</em>,' which operated
somewhat like a spark in a powder magazine at this date. A quotation from
Edmund Burke's speech, referring to the day most suitable for the discussion
of the Regency Bill, is added at the foot of the plate: 'Why not debate it on
Friday? I say it is the only day in the year on which it ought to be debated
(Charles's martyrdom), and carried up in the <em>Black Box</em>.'</p>

<p>1789. <cite>State Butchers.</cite>&mdash;In this view of the Prince's situation, the Heir
Apparent is pictured as the victim of the combinations which Pitt contrived to
hinder the Prince's accession to power by vexatious restrictions. The principal
figure is that of the future Regent, laid out at length on the anatomy table,
ready to be operated upon by the dissecting knives which his antagonists are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_246" id="Page_i_246">[246]</a></span>
eagerly setting to work. Pitt occupies the chair as president of this college of
Surgeons; in his left hand is a paper, '<em>Thanks from the City of London with
50,000l.</em>' He is holding a wand in his right hand, with which he is pointing
to the heart of his subject, beneath the Prince's Star of Brunswick; he is thus
directing his head anatomist, <span class="locked">Dundas:&mdash;</span>'The good qualities of his heart will
certainly ruin our plan; therefore cut that out first.' Lord Thurlow, in his
Chancellor's robes, is, like Hamlet, musing over the head of the fallen prince.
Lord Sydney has his knife held ready for a desperate gash. The two Stuart
peers are assisting as amateur butchers. The Duke of Grafton has a dissecting
knife in either hand; at his feet is a formidable basket of saws and cutting instruments;
his preparations are on an extensive scale, while the Duke of Richmond
is prepared to resort to even clumsier methods, since <em>Uncle Toby</em> is wielding a
heavy executioner's axe in readiness to cut in at any signal.</p>

<p><i>February 6, 1789.</i> <cite><a href="#SPEAKER">A New Speaker</a>.</cite> Published by H. Holland, Oxford Street.&mdash;Addington,
the Speaker, is at his table. Pitt, standing behind him, has thrust
a speaking trumpet into his mouth, through which the orator, to the amazement
of the other members, is holding forth: 'Eyes has he and sees not, neither is
there any breath in his mouth, but through the hollow of his head shall the
sound of my own voice be exalted, and through the stuttering of his tongue my
intentions be more fully explained. Keep together, my good friends, till I go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_247" id="Page_i_247">[247]</a></span>
out, and you will then probably follow me, but I will work changes for you.
See how this rank Tory becomes a good Whig!' The mace is lying on the
table beside the '<em>City Address, 50,000l.</em>; <em>Aldermen Hoppikicky</em>, <em>Squintum</em>,
<em>Peter Grievous, &amp;c.</em>,' and a proposed <em>List of Taxes</em>, which includes such items
as <em>Fox-tails</em>, <em>Play</em> (<em>i.e.</em> gambling) <em>Houses</em> &amp;c., fanciful personal enactments
levelled against Pitt's great rival.</p>

<p><i>February 7, 1789.</i> <cite>Britannia's Support, or the Conspirators Defeated.</cite> Published
by H. Holland, Oxford Street.&mdash;The Prince, who is looking somewhat ill at
ease under the circumstances, has been attacked by Pitt and his allies, the Stuart
dukes. Pitt is aiming an awkward blow at the tutelary divinity and her
prot&eacute;g&eacute; with a terrible-looking axe. The Duke of Richmond is firing a musket;
and the Duke of Grafton, as a midnight assassin, is operating with a dagger and
a dark lantern. Britannia has taken the Heir Apparent to her arms, and is
shielding the menaced Prince with her person.</p>

<p><i>February 7, 1789.</i> <cite>The Hospital for Lunatics.</cite>&mdash;A companion to the
preceding. The results of the Tory excitement have landed certain sufferers
in the Lunatic Asylum. The mad doctor is going his rounds, he is declaring;
'I see no signs of convalescence!' His assistant, following with a few strait-waistcoats
for the refractory patients, is supporting the opinion of his chief: 'They
must all be in a state of coercion!' Pitt is the first sufferer; he is wearing a
coronet of straws, and is waving a sceptre of twigs; over his head is the notice:
'<em>Went mad, supposing himself next heir to a Crown</em>.' In the adjoining cell is the
Duke of Richmond, who is buried in the contemplation of toy cannons&mdash;'<em>Went
mad in the study of fortifications</em>.' Next to him is another victim, '<em>Driven mad by
a political itching</em>.'</p>

Magnificence; dedicated to Mr. Pitt and his 267 Liberal friends.</cite> Published by
William Holland, 50 Oxford Street.&mdash;This print, with one or two others of
similar character, have been attributed to Kingsbury. A careful comparison of
these doubtful plates, with the more recognised etchings of both Rowlandson
and Kingsbury, has led the writer to the conclusion that several at least of the
caricatures published by Holland at this time, owe their existence, at least in
part, to the skill of the former, although he has in some degree modified his
usual handling.</p>

<p>The Heir Apparent is proceeding in burlesque state to the chamber of Peers.
A ragged mob is in attendance. The arms on his carriage are turned upside
down, coachman and footmen are of the shabbiest, and the slovenly coach is
drawn by eight miserable animals, who can barely crawl, while one of the broken-kneed
leaders has actually come to grief. The Tories have taken their places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_248" id="Page_i_248">[248]</a></span>
at certain windows to view the procession. The Duke of Orleans (who was on
a visit to this country), or the French Ambassador, is amazed at such a dowdy
spectacle; next to his window is Lord Amherst. The Stuart-Dukes of Richmond
and Grafton, sharing a window, are agreeing that the Prince's turn-out is 'Well
enough for any of the Brunswick race;' they have put up at the sign of the
'<em>Lion in the Toils</em>.' The Marquis of Carmarthen is saying, 'Very pretty indeed;'
he is at the sign of '<em>The Restrictions</em>' (a picture of the Prince in the pillory is on
the signboard); his neighbour Pitt is declaring the show to be 'a very magnificent
spectacle, upon my honour.' Lords Hood and Chatham, at the sign of '<em>The
Chatham and Hood</em>,' a frigate labouring in a storm being the signboard, are on
the look-out: 'The great naval review was nothing to it.' Lord Chatham is
assuring his companion that the show is 'infinitely superior to my father's
funeral.' Lord Thurlow is asseverating with an oath, 'It eclipses all that has

Co.</cite> Published by S. W. Fores.&mdash;The health of the King, according to the
reports of his physicians, began to improve from this date. It was hinted rather
broadly that this intelligence was not so agreeable to the Opposition as they
might desire. The print sets forth the new treatment by which the growing
consequence of the Whigs was to be reduced. The several patients are placed
in small furnaces, with a blazing fire below each; the doctors are attending to
the stoking with a will. Burke is becoming quite limp in the process: 'I have
got no juice left.' Fox is becoming furious; he is gesticulating and shouting, 'I
have sweated enough.' Sheridan is venemous: 'This is scandalous; the Baily's
(Bailiffs) have sufficiently sweated me!' The Prince, in an agony, is crying: 'I
suppose they call this a Regency sweat.' A lady next to him is declaring: 'I sweat
with desire.' Weltj&eacute;, the Prince's house-steward and head cook&mdash;a man who
enjoyed considerable reputation in spite of the satirists&mdash;is asserting: 'I never
sweat so much at cooking in my life.' Mrs. Fitzherbert, who is separated from
her admirer, is highly indignant: 'I sweat with jealousy; what disregard to the
marriage right!'</p>

his counsellor's gown, has come to 'kiss hands.' According to the print <cite>the

Irish bull; the riders have their faces to the tails, by which they have taken hold
in order to secure their seats. The Marquis of Lothian and the Duke of
Leinster are urging the deputation forward. It is understood they have arrived
somewhat late. The holder of the address is declaring: 'Aye, aye, the Marquis
of Buckingham will remember me when I go back again.' The other deputies
are making pertinent observations: 'The folks stare at us as they would at wild
beastises!' 'What a nice errand is this; make him Regent whether or no!' 'I
say, my friend, we shall be there the day before the fair!' 'Well! yes, I dare say
well! why, he was so bad he could say nothing but "<em>What, what, what</em>," when
we left Dublin!' 'What, no occasion for a Regent? then we will go back again
and tell the lads we are all mad, and, by the powers, 'tis my opinion we are come
over for nothing at all, at all!' The cook of the <em>Pall Mall Ordinary</em> is thrusting
his stout body out of a window opposite Carlton House and declaring: 'Begar,
I must go prepare more sourkraut for dese wild bullocks!'</p>

<p><i>March 15, 1789.</i> <cite>Irish Ambassadors Extraordinary!!! In a few days will

on their prancing bulls, with a sack of potatoes behind each for a saddle, and as
provisions for the journey; all are armed with bludgeons. The delegates are
headed by a personage with a crozier and a mitre, a sort of episcopal leader, who
is exhorting his followers to 'Make haste, my honies!' The Duke of Leinster
is flourishing his shillalagh: 'No restrictions, by the Holy Cross of St. Patrick!'
Others are crying: 'How our Majority will astonish the young King!' Some
doubt crosses their minds as to his Majesty's possible restoration to health: 'My
dear, I was told that he was recovering fast!' 'No! as mad as a hatter!'</p>

Lord Robert Fitzgerald pleasantly, when he heard of the mischievous folly.
But wishing to do the best he could for his brother, he ordered him the <em>Constitutional</em>
uniform of <em>Blue</em> and <em>Orange</em>. This, of course, the Duke, when he came,
would not wear; and new clothes being hastily wanted, Jennings and Headington,
the tailors, were left at liberty, <em>and they made the</em> <span class="smcap">GREAT OPEN POCKET</span> <em>on

proprietor of these unruly animals begs leave, through the channel of
the <em>World</em>, to return his most grateful thanks for the great encouragement Mr.
<span class="smcap">Grattan's</span> <em>Bulls</em> met with in London, and most particularly from their Royal
Highnesses the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York.</p>

<p>'He is sorry to say that upon the road these animals grew very unruly. The
completely horned one was four times beaten, for taking what did not belong to
him; and the <em>little bull</em>, called 'my lord,' who had but a stump of a tail, had that
cut off by a wicked boy for his diversion.</p>

<p>'The other four all tumbled into the water, as they landed at Dublin, and
looked so ill, when they were driven into Mr. Grattan's stable, "that he wished
to heaven he had never sent them over!"</p>

<p>'The proprietor has likewise to add, that they were so well fed by the kindness
of the gentlemen in London, that they do not again take kindly to Irish
potatoes. He hopes, however, by beating them regularly every day, he shall
drive sense into them.</p>

<p>'The collection for seeing these amazing animals upon the road was very
handsome. Since their arrival here, the Lord-Lieutenant has had an offer of
them for sale, and <em>very cheap</em>; but he thought they had been so "hawked about,"
by being up at public show in London, he would have nothing to do with them.
So the bulls are where they were&mdash;with the proprietor.'</p>

<p><i>March 2, 1789.</i> <cite>The Prince's Answer to the Address of the Deputation
from Ireland.</cite> (<cite>Morning Herald</cite>).&mdash;'"If, in conveying my grateful sentiments
on their conduct, in relation to the King, my father, and to the inseparable interests
of the two kingdoms, I find it impossible adequately to express my feelings
on what relates to <em>myself</em>, I trust you will not be the less disposed to believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_251" id="Page_i_251">[251]</a></span>
that I have an understanding to comprehend the value of what they have done,
a heart that must remember, and principles that will not suffer me to abuse their
confidence.</p>

<p>'"But the fortunate change which has taken place in the circumstances which
gave occasion to the Address agreed to by the Lords and Commons of Ireland
induces me for a few days to delay giving a final answer; trusting that the joyful
event of his Majesty's resuming the personal exercise of his Royal authority
may then render it only necessary for me to repeat those sentiments of gratitude
and affection for the loyal and generous people of Ireland which I feel indelibly
imprinted on my heart."</p>

<p>'The Prince of Wales has conducted himself in this delicate point with the
circumspection and propriety that has marked the whole of his conduct in the
late melancholy and critical circumstances. He called to his aid the first legal
ability in the kingdom; and on the subject of the answer to the Irish Address
had a conference of several hours with the Lord Chancellor and Lord Loughborough.'</p>

<p><i>March 16, 1789.</i> <cite>The Ambassadors' Extraordinary Return, on Bulls without
Horns.</cite> Published by S. W. Fores.&mdash;The same personages we saw caricatured
on the previous plate are represented in the sequel returning to Dublin. They
have exchanged their famous Irish bulls for donkeys; their potatoes have gone,
but they are liberally provided with <em>Regency Cakes</em> in their place. Their Pope,
whose donkey's head is ornamented with the plume of three feathers as borne
by the Prince of Wales, is received by an eager deputation on his arrival:
'What news, what news? The tidings tell. Make haste and tell us all; say why are
they thus mounted? Is the Regent come and all?' The leader is replying:
'I'll tell you all in no time. Why, you must know the King is better than the
Regent&mdash;that is all!' The Marquis of Lothian is declaring, 'Master Walgee
(Weltj&eacute;) made us such Regent's and Regency cakes!' The Duke of Leinster is
crying, 'Aye, my lads, Dr. Willis has done the King over, and the Regent
won't take it!' Other members of the deputation are remarking, 'The English
lads were so merry, by my shoul, they were always a-laughing at us!' 'Ambassadors
Extraordinary, by St. Patrick, but I've forgot what we have done!'
'Done? Why carried the address, and brought it back again, with all these cakes.
A deal better than potatoes!'</p>

<p><i>April 4, 1789.</i> <cite>The Rochester Address, or the Corporation going to Eat Roast
Pork and Oysters with the Regent.</cite>&mdash;The procession of the Corporation of Rochester
is headed by the Mayor (Matthews), who is holding the <em>Address</em> at the end of
a pole; he proposes to send the Regent 'some chips.' The rest of this train,
professional men and traders of Rochester, are promising to favour the heir to
the throne with their specialities. Alderman Spice will 'assist him with long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_252" id="Page_i_252">[252]</a></span>
sixes.' Alderman Thompson will favour him with his <em>Preventative</em>; another, a
brewer, will send him 'some <em>Chatham Butt</em>;' Prentice professes to 'give him
thirteen to the dozen, and all sour;' another member of the Corporation, a
barber by trade, is proposing to 'shave him.' Sparks, a lawyer, is declaring,
'I'll beg to speak to Sherry for his business, bailing, actions, demands, writs of
error; that is, if he'll promise to see me paid!' Bristow is guaranteeing 'he
shall never be tried by the Court of Conscience.' Robinson is asserting, 'These
are your right sort; none of your quack;' and Alderman Nicholson, who is
bringing up the rear, with a brick and trowel, is looking forward to the job 'of
making him some fortifications!'</p>

<p><i>April 22, 1789.</i> <cite>The Grand Procession to St. Paul's on St. George's Day,
1789: an exact view of the Lord Mayor carrying the City Sword, bareheaded, &amp;c.</cite>
Published by Holland, Oxford Street.&mdash;Upon the King's recovery the popular
tide turned abruptly, and, before the end of April, the satirists were making
capital out of the excessive gush of loyalty which greeted the King's restoration
to health. The felicitations offered on this occasion were not, however, more
extravagant than the congratulations which would have been offered the Regent
had the case been altered. In the present print the procession is on its way to
St. Paul's to return thanks; the Volunteers are keeping the line of route; the
windows are filled with rejoicing spectators, smiling and bowing, with ribands,
favours, and mottoes, inscribed with printed sentiments complimentary to the
monarch. A man, wearing a leek in his hat, is at the head of the train, seated
on a goat; the Aldermen, without hats or wigs, are finding some difficulty in
keeping their seats. The Lord Mayor has a nervous time of it, while holding
the Sword of State; two footmen are steadying him by the leg&mdash;his horse has
been slightly startled&mdash;as he is passing a noisy band of musicians, stationed in
a balcony. 'And all the people rejoiced and sung, Long live the King! May
the King live for ever!' The King's well-appointed team of eight white
horses is passing a show&mdash;the Royal Waxworks: 'Here you may see King
Solomon in all his glory!' The state carriage contains the King, the Queen,
and the coarse-featured Madame Schwellenberg; the Guards are bringing up
the rear.</p>

versions of the plate, as green, faced with crimson, and richly laced with gold; with
a furred cocked hat and enormous cockade; inscribed on the scarf he is wearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_253" id="Page_i_253">[253]</a></span>
are the words '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive la Libert&eacute;!</i>' destined shortly to become the keynote for all
the reckless destruction, indiscriminate slaughter, and bloodthirsty atrocities of
the great French Revolution. An enormous sabre is trailed by his side, and he
is resting on a halbert with a head shaped like an axe. By his side is his
drummer, whose figure the artist has treated with the broadest grotesque; the
Frenchman's enormous earrings, together with a pigtail of inordinate length, are
exciting the wonder of the spectators. The <em>Sergent Recruiteur</em> is beating up his
recruits at Billingsgate amongst the fishfags. The <em>Poissardes</em> of France were
making themselves a terrible reputation throughout Europe by the violence of
their behaviour, and the satirist hinted in the present plate that the Duke of
Orleans would be able to secure congenial revolutionary levies amongst the
muscular vixens of the fish-market here. The viragoes of Billingsgate do not
seem to favour the Duke's mission; they are giving the Frenchman what may
be termed a warm reception: his advances are met with taunts, contumely, and
apparently by challenges to ignominious personal combat.</p>

<p><i>January 1, 1789.</i> <cite><a href="#GROG">Grog on Board</a>.</cite> Published by S. W. Fores, 3 Piccadilly.
Republished January 1794.&mdash;'Sweet Poll of Plymouth' has been smuggled on
board during the absence, let us believe, of the chief officers, who have genteelly
gone to take <cite><a href="#TEA">Tea on Shore</a></cite> in the port. A pretty 'mid-shipmite' and a black
boy are deep in the perusal of a volume of fascinating voyages. The rest of the
persons represented are, from the dog upwards, variously interested in their fair
female visitor. One tar, in a fur cap, is singing verses, with his truant eye fixed
on the nymph instead of on his music; another old salt, who is handing the
punchbowl about, has evidently neglected his pipe, which he is vainly endeavouring
to rekindle from the bowl of a comrade, who has eyes for nothing but
the lady. 'Poll' is quite a Cleopatra for beauty, grace, and love of pleasure,
if not for frailty and splendour; she is reposing with negligent ease in the
stalwart arms of a good-looking sailor, for want of a more luxurious couch, and
her foot is resting on the knee of another favoured swain, who seems proportionately
proud of the honour. Her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d&eacute;bonnaire</i> ladyship is not only distinguished
for the beauty of person and condescension of manners essential to make
herself adored by poor Jack; she sports the wealth of jewellery supposed to be
irresistibly gratifying in his sight&mdash;a pair of bracelets, earrings, imposing shoe-buckles,
and, to cap all, a <em>pair</em> of watches, with massive chains and heavy trinkets
galore, disposed on either side.</p>

suppositious contrast between high and low life in port. The officers
are leaving the vulgar jollifications of <cite>Grog on Board</cite> for delicate flirtations
over the tea-table on shore. In those days, when opportunities for personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_254" id="Page_i_254">[254]</a></span>
distinction were more frequent, commanders were recognised and entertained
as heroes, and their visits on shore were not unfrequently a round of agreeable
festivals and social triumphs. Rowlandson has shown how graciously the
fair are regarding the sons of Neptune, who are doing their best to create<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_255" id="Page_i_255">[255]</a></span>
favourable impressions in return. The head of the house, who is not apparently
of the slightest consequence on this occasion, is left to indifference and the
charge of the tea urn; while the naval commanders are carrying all the admiration
before them, on the venerable principle, lyrically rendered by John Dryden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_256" id="Page_i_256">[256]</a></span>

quandary; he is seated by the fire, where the kettle is boiling over, deluging the
place, and threatening the invalid with the dangers of scalding. The table, and
the little comforts spread thereon, are thrown down in the struggle to get out
of the dangerous vicinity; the gouty cripple is vainly shouting and storming for
assistance; his nurse, who is much too young, sprightly, and good-looking for
her situation, is seen at the door of the apartment, struggling in the embraces of
a dashing young spark&mdash;probably the master's undutiful heir; the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coquetteries</i>

by the sudden entrance on the occupations of the toilette of a roystering

conducted on popular principles, as the notice on the lantern has it: '<em>Shave with
ease and expedition for one penny</em>.' It will be noticed that the lathering is
accomplished on a wholesale scale; a boy is waiting on the customers with a
small pail of soap, and is officiating with a lathering-brush of the size of a decent
hearth-broom; the barber is waiting, with his razor poised in the air, ready to
let it descend with a swoop on the face of the sufferer; expedition of execution
rather than an artistic delicacy of handling being the order of the day
at the class of establishment delineated by the caricaturist, who in the days of
universal shaving must have known the cost of sacrificing to custom.</p>

in a barber's cloth, has taken his seat in the shaving-chair; his wig is removed
and his chin plenteously lathered; the aproned barber is still employed with
his soap and basin. One customer is performing an ablution; and the assistant,
whose hair is dressed in the wildest French style, is smoothing down a compact
full-bottomed old-fashioned wig. One or two barber's blocks, a cracked
glass, and a bird in a cage form the chief embellishments, to which must be
added a lantern lighted by a single candle and inscribed with this information,
'<em>The oldest shaving shop in London. Most money for second-hand wigs.</em>'</p>

<p><i>About 1789.</i> <cite>Domestic Shaving.</cite>&mdash;A family group, delicately executed in
stipple in imitation of a chalk drawing. The scene is pictured with considerable
care and truthfulness to nature. A stout gentleman, wigless and
with lather-spread chin, is rasping away at his ample throat before a hand-glass,
which a gracefully-drawn female, in a simple morning dress, is holding before the
'shaver.' A pretty child is seated in an infant's chair by his side, watching,
with a pleased smile on her face, the gambols of a cat and kitten.</p>

of distinguished guests are represented as trying a cruise on board the Southampton
frigate. An elevated personage, judging from his star and riband,
has secured his cocked hat with a handkerchief tied under his chin; he is suffering
the discomforts of sea-sickness. The helmsman has some difficulty in steering,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_259" id="Page_i_259">[259]</a></span>
surrounded as he is by a group of limp persons of fashion; a fat dowager, who
has propped herself against the back of the steersman, is trying to subdue her
qualms by applying to cordials; a more dignified lady is indulging in attitudes
expressive of tragic despair. Three fair creatures have abandoned themselves
to utter prostration on the opposite side. The sailors are exhibiting their disgust
at the operation of washing down the decks and attending to the necessities of
the sufferers; fresh supplies of buckets, for the accommodation of the indisposed,
are being handed up from below by a brace of 'Beef-eaters,' whose presence, so
far from adding dignity to the company, is a source of inconvenience, since they
too are painfully sea-sick; and their halberts, from the incapacity of the holders,
are threatening mischief to the helpless passengers around.</p>

<p>1789. <cite>A Cart Race.</cite> Published by William Holland, Oxford Street, 1789.&mdash;This
plate bears Rowlandson's signature, and is dated 1788. The print is
executed in bold outline, filled in with aquatint, and coloured in capital imitation
of the original drawing. The lowly cottages of some hamlet are partly distinguishable
through the prodigious clouds of dust raised by the unruly eccentricities of a
pleasure-party, represented as taking the air in three overladen and ramshackle
carts, drawn by wretched horses barely one remove from the knacker's yard.</p>

<p>The amusement of the moment is an extemporised race. One cart is leading
triumphantly; the horse is dashing along, urged on by the bludgeon of a costermonger,
who is conducting a party of beauties from St. Giles's, of the most florid
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d&eacute;gag&eacute;</i> type. Cart number two is considerably overmanned; the horse is
down; the driver is alternately trying to whip his horse into animation or to lash
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_261" id="Page_i_261">[261]</a></span>
his antagonists. One free-and-easy lady is falling over the head of the cart, and
two more are being spilt over the tail, where they are sprawling in attitudes of
considerable freedom; a dog is indignantly barking at the fallen. A third cart,
which is in the rear, is loaded so heavily that it seems there is difficulty in
persuading the horse to start at all.</p>

their horror at the husband's obliquity.</p>

<p>1789. <cite>She don't Deserve it.</cite> Designed and etched by T. Rowlandson;
aquatinted by I. Roberts. Published by William Holland, 50 Oxford Street.&mdash;A
pretty servant-maid, who has evidently been detected in some irregularity, is
literally 'kicked out,' <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en deshabille</i>, by a tartar of a mistress. The old master, who
is evidently the cause of the damsel's disgrace, and who has lost his wig in the
confusion of the disclosure, is 'starting like a guilty thing,' obviously anticipating
the connubial wrath which, in due course, will descend on his reprobate head.</p>

<p><i>September 1789.</i> <cite>Bay of Biscay.</cite> Designed and published by T. Rowlandson,
1 James Street, Adelphi.&mdash;A ship is tossing on the stormy waters of the Bay of
Biscay; a boatload of passengers, who have put off from the distant vessel,
seems likely to be swamped by the waves, which are rolling mountains high.
Fear and helplessness prevail on all sides; the sea is running too roughly for the
oars to be of much avail; the captain and his crew have, it appears, abandoned
their ship for the questionable chance of escaping in the long-boat; there are
three ladies with them; one has apparently swooned, another is leaning over the
side, with clasped hands, terrified at the imminence of the danger; and the third
is in paroxysms which necessitate her forcible restraint. Rowlandson possessed
the skill and perception to bring out every point in a desperate situation with
thrilling effect, and his masterly power of depicting 'horrors,' &amp;c., is in its way
more striking, perhaps, even than his felicitous art of hitting off the salient
humours of any of those ludicrous situations which his fanciful and inventive
faculties suggested in exhaustless succession.</p>

<p>1789. <cite>Chelsea Reach.</cite> Designed and published by T. Rowlandson, 1 James
Street, Adelphi.&mdash;A wondrous contrast to the horrors of the companion print,
the <cite>Bay of Biscay</cite>; all is sunshine, jollification, and happiness. A gaily-decorated
shallop, somewhat like a miniature edition of a state barge, is proceeding up the
river with a pleasure-party, rowed by six gaily-clad watermen, wearing jockey
caps, as was the custom of the time. A party of highly genteel ladies and
gentlemen are exchanging courtesies, and pledging healths and toasts, under
the shade of their parasols; an amateur musician is entertaining his friends with
serenades on his flute, players on French horns are contributing to the diversion,
a servant in livery is at the helm, and a large union-jack is flying. In the
background is seen the tranquil river, with its distant bridges.</p>

<p><i>November 1789.</i> <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Place des Victoires.</cite>&mdash;If Rowlandson's visits to Paris
had produced no other memorial than his inimitable picture <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Place des
Victoires, Paris</i>, we should be satisfied with the result of his familiarity with
Parisian life at the period immediately antecedent to the Revolutionary era.</p>

<p>The study, as a whole, is one of the most memorable we can ascribe to his
skilful hand and his remarkable powers of profitable observation. The Circus,
built by Mansard, one of the features of Paris under the Grand Monarque,
remains in all its freshness to the present day; but it has shared the fate a
similar monument would have suffered had it remained in the busy precincts of
the East of London. Finding itself in the heart, as it were, of the trading centre
of the city, near the Bourse, and hedged and elbowed around by the warehouses
and industries of the busy commercial population, it has undergone an indignity
which would vex the spirit of its founder and make the shade of the little
monarch, in honour of whose victories it was erected and christened, exclaim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_263" id="Page_i_263">[263]</a></span>
against the degeneracy which the taste of his countrymen has undergone, and he
would probably deplore the concession to utilitarianism which has transmogrified
the well-known spot. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Place des Victoires</i> in its present aspect is curiously
disguised by hideous placards; between each of the columns appear two or more
humorous advertising boards, filling up the intermediate spaces, and inscribed
with recommendations to purchasers to secure their wardrobe <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au bon Diable</i>, and
notices of a similar inviting character. Rowlandson has given a further indication
of the Parisian centre&mdash;at the expense of topographical accuracy, it must be
admitted&mdash;by introducing the towers of Notre Dame in a proximity somewhat
closer than is legitimately warranted by the actual position of the mother church.</p>

<p>The monument, as seen in Rowlandson's veracious representation, is a splendid
example of exaggerated glorification. The statue of a warrior&mdash;surely not intended
to resemble the stout little monarch to whose glory it is dedicated&mdash;is
trampling on an allegorical personage typifying the conquered enemies of France;
while the figure of Fame, holding her trumpet ready to sound the victor's
praises, is crowning the hero with a wreath. Four chained slaves, cast in bronze,
indicative of Louis' triumphs, are shown at the base; these figures may now be
seen in the Louvre. A courtier, or a disabled general, is pushed along in a
ramshackle carriage, a sort of wheeled sedan, drawn by an old soldier, with two
footmen to follow; the Frenchman is regarding the stupendous monument raised
to the glories of the Grand Nation with rapturous devotion. An <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">abb&eacute;</i>, with his
hands in an enormous muff, is passing, with his nose in the air; a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coquette à la
mode</i> is leaning on his arm and raising her hood to shoot forth glances of fascination;
a handsome young officer, wearing a monstrous <em>queue</em>, is launching an
admiring look towards the fair beguiler; but her attention is engaged elsewhere,
and the Parthian shot falls harmless. A shoeblack in the foreground is teaching
a poodle to dance; the comical animal's head is decorated with an old peruke. A
pair of extensive beaux of the period are seen saluting each other with elaborate
bows which would have filled the late Mr. Simpson, M.C., with despair. In the
right-hand corner is shown a monk (Sterne's original <em>Brother Lorenzo</em>), shrinking
away from recollections of the past. A downright English John Bull, in huge
riding-boots, and a pretty English girl, his companion, in a habit, lacking the
surrounding enthusiasm, are looking at the monument with the indifference of
travellers who are in duty bound to take note of all the sights, but who, beyond
the principle involved, find small gratification in the ordeal; an English mastiff,
the property of the strangers, is curiously regarding another exotic, an Italian
greyhound. In the distance is shown a female porter and her donkey, followed
by a procession of friars; a French nobleman and his lady are driving by in
gallant state, with a <em>Suisse</em> and a whole string of genteel footmen clinging like
flies behind their chariot.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_264" id="Page_i_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>As the founder took some pains to inform the world (that is to say, Paris,
which, to Frenchmen under the reign of the Grand Monarque, meant the universe),
this wonderful structure, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la gloire de Louis le Grand</i>, was erected by the Duc
de la Feuillade, one of the idols of his age, and first satellite to the <em>Sun of
Versailles</em>; Peer and Marshal of France, Governor of the Dauphin, Colonel of
the Guards, &amp;c.&mdash;in every way a most distinguished person. The statue was
erected in front of this eminent courtier's Paris mansion, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hôtel de la Feuillade</i>.
The principle of its erection was ingenious, ostensibly commemorating the
glories of his master, the 'father of his people, and the conductor of invincible
armies;' the celebrity of the patriotic founder of this monument is barely of
secondary prominence, since his name and various high offices, emblazoned on
the same pile, were bequeathed at the same time to the everlasting regard of
posterity. The perpetual durability of fame in this case was doomed to last one
century, and no more: the calculations of the Marshal did not include the coming
French Revolution. In the January of 1793, the 'grand nation' became intoxicated
with a saturnalia of blood, in which they avenged imposts, burdens, and
slavery&mdash;evils which they had suffered in the past&mdash;by sacrificing the descendant
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le Grand Monarque</i>, a passive victim, on the scaffold to the vicious legacies
of his predecessors. The fury which had made a martyr of the king, whose
chief enjoyment had been the alleviation of the condition of his subjects, taking
a retrospective turn, vented its destructive rage on every relic which recalled
the servitude of generations&mdash;after the slaughter of the living, the national
vengeance was wreaked on inanimate objects, and very naturally the ill-advised
monument of the Place des Victoires came in for an early share of attention; and
the memorial bequeathed to the everlasting admiration of posterity was scattered
to the winds in a manner which effectually defeated the intentions of the testator;
the only wonder being how the bronze figures escaped the fate of the furnace,
and were spared being converted into artillery.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances, of the complete disappearance of this triumph of
servile adulation, it is interesting to recall, in a remote degree, the incidents
which attended its foundation. In the letters of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;</span> we trace a
picture indicative of the events; first we are introduced to the zeal displayed by
the Duc de la Feuillade, that inveterate and unequalled courtier, and his passion
for raising monuments to the glorification of his master and himself. We follow
the Marshal's first intentions, and are told how they were modified; we notice
the erection of the pedestrian statue, with its glaring anomalies, sent to adorn the
gardens of Versailles; and then we are instructed how the sculptor, Van den
Bogaert&mdash;who, in compliment to his patrons, had changed his name to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de
Desjardins</i>&mdash;was entrusted with the execution of the extraordinary conception
which was to shed a lustre on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place des Victoires</i> to perpetuity.</p>

of more refined character than Rowlandson generally selects for representation.
The owners evidently occupy a wealthy position in life. The lady has
musical tastes, it appears; in the background is a harpsicord, the fair performer
is playing the harp, and a guitar is lying at her feet. The husband has no soul
for sweet sounds, or the soothing harmonies which his elegant companion has
produced have lulled him into forgetfulness; however it may happen, the
gentleman is very evidently, and unpoetically, fast asleep.</p>

has taken a vexatious institution, as enforced in his day, and turned
it to satiric account. A vicar, who we presume is suffering for the sin of
gluttony&mdash;a failing to which at one time, if tradition is in any degree reliable, the
sons of most churches were more than slightly prone&mdash;since he is invalided by
an attack of gout, is seated in the official reception-room of his residence, within
view of his cure, in state, as becomes a dignitary of the Establishment, to receive
the tithes of his parish. His clerk is planted by his side, auditing <em>An Estimate of
the Tythes of this Parish</em>. This functionary is examining, with somewhat minute
scrupulousness, a fat pig which is borne in for approval by a comely maiden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_269" id="Page_i_269">[269]</a></span>

<p>An exaggerated view from a Conservative point of observation, of the results
which were to be anticipated if the repeal of the Test Act was allowed to be
carried.</p>

<p>This caricature was put forth at the time Doctors Priestley and Price&mdash;those
<em>revolution sinners</em>, as their opponents styled them&mdash;were lecturing and
spreading broadcast principles of religious equality, reforms, which, as the
Ministers industriously circulated, if carried into effect, would prove subversive
of everything. A portly Bishop, with his <em>Refutation of Dr. Price</em> by his side,
is left to the tender mercies of the Reformers&mdash;'And when they had smote the
shepherd, the sheep were scattered.' The work of revision is carried on by main
force, two of the 'new lights,' aided by stout cudgels, are converting the overgrown
Shepherd: 'Make room for the Apostle of Liberty;' and 'God assisting
us, nothing is to be feared.' Doctor Priestley is superintending the demolition
of the venerated edifice: 'Make haste to pull down that, and we'll build a new
one in its place.' Two of the Reformers are displaying their 'brotherly love' by
fighting for the possession of the Chancellor's purse and mace. The <em>Thirty-nine
Articles</em> are sent to feed a bonfire. A leader of the movement, inspired by 'love
of our country,' has climbed up where the insignia of church and state are seen
swinging upon a sign-post. He is provided with a flaming <em>Torch of Liberty</em>, with
which he is threatening their destruction.</p>

<p>Fox is shown as the arch-director of this innovating <span class="locked">agitation:&mdash;</span>'day next, a
charity sermon by the Rev. Charles Fox.' The Whig chief is drawn at a
window, armed with a speaking-trumpet, and advertising '<em>Places under Government
to be disposed of. N.B. Several Faro and E. O. Tables in good condition.</em>'
Dissenting preachers are hurrying up, furnished with well-filled money-bags, to
secure the political influence which Fox is openly holding out for purchase,
without any attempt at disguise.</p>

H. Angelo in his 'Reminiscences.' The companion, <cite><a href="#ITALIAN">An Italian Family</a></cite>, will be
given under the head of caricatures published in 1792. Both impressions are
scarce, and very seldom met with. These prints are supposed to represent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_273" id="Page_i_273">[273]</a></span>
domestic and interior lives of foreign artists, as studied from observations
founded, it is presumed, on the everyday habits of the aliens domiciled in
England. Monsieur and his family are probably professional dancers, and the
picture introduces us to their more intimate hours of practising; at all events,
we find nearly the entire generation giving up their energies&mdash;somewhat to
the neglect of the proprieties, it is true&mdash;to the practice of the one accomplishment
in which the politest of nations was supposed to enjoy pre-eminence. The
grandfather, in a cotton nightcap, is supplying the music from his fiddle, but the
contagion of motion is affecting his aged limbs, and he is skipping about with
the animation of old Vestris; by his side is the youngest child, who, still in her
night-clothes, is practising the first positions. It will be noticed that, in spite of
somewhat squalid surroundings, the whole generation excel in personal finery:
a profusion of hair, dressed in the extreme of fashion, ruffles, furbelows, frills,
bows, ear-rings, and elegant slippers, are displayed by the various members.</p>

<p>The son and daughter are gracefully executing a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pas de deux</i>. The person
of Madame is charmingly rendered; an elaborately constructed tower of fair
hair, and a nodding plume of feathers, add height and distinction to her figure,
to which the designer has lent a grace and ease of motion peculiarly French.
Monsieur is truly magnificent in the item of wig; his pink satin coat is hung on
the top of the turn-up bedstead, and he is disporting himself in a sleeved vest;
the lower limbs of the gentleman give room for conjecture. Whether he has
taken the liberty of appearing in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans-culotte</i> negligence out of respect to the
principles of the Revolution, then in its fury, or whether his nether garments
and stockings have been pledged to satisfy the necessities of the hour, is not
clear. Perhaps the artist drew the Frenchman in this guise as a concession to
English prejudices at the period when it was a pretty universally received
theory that his compatriots lived on frogs exclusively, and had thrown away
their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">culottes</i> for good; the last supposition being to a large degree warranted
by the maniacal excesses of the Jacobin, Poissarde, and other sections in Paris.
In the left-hand corner of the picture is a cleverly designed group, somewhat
independent of the main action. A French child, dressed in the burlesque of
miniature manhood, as then adopted by our tasteful neighbours, is playing a
pipe and tambourine and training a pair of performing poodles to dance a
minuet on their hind legs. A lean cat is vainly trying to find something to
satisfy her hunger in the cupboard. The only decent article of furniture in the
chamber&mdash;which is dirty, patched, and poor&mdash;is a concession to vanity in the
form of a large mirror.</p>

gamblers who lately occupied the front of the table are upset in the confusion,
and others are endeavouring to get out of the way of the danger. A stout old
buck in the King's uniform&mdash;a loser, it would seem, from his empty pocket-book&mdash;has
drawn his pistol on a player opposite, who has presumably won the irate
gentleman's gold, since he is covering the pile with one hand, and with the
other is aiming, in his turn, a pistol full at his adversary's person. Great excitement
prevails around; one man is dashing a chair at the officer's outstretched
firearm, and a brother officer is striking with a bottle and a candlestick at the
other weapon; bludgeons are flourished, and swords are drawn by some of the
gamblers, while others are endeavouring to stand clear before the bullets begin

at the Royal Chocolate-house in St. James's Street, where disputes at hazard
produced a quarrel, which became general throughout the room. Three gentlemen
were mortally wounded, and the affray was at length concluded by the interposition
of the Royal Guards, who were compelled to knock the parties down
with the butt ends of their muskets indiscriminately, as entreaties and commands
were of no avail. A footman of Colonel Cunningham's, greatly attached to his
master, rushed through the swords, seized, and literally carried him out by force
without injury.</p>

<p><i>May 29, 1790.</i> <cite>Who kills first for a Crown.</cite> In two compartments.&mdash;The
objects of the chase being the respective crowns of two kingdoms, both
of which were disturbed at the date of this publication, by the ambitious views
of the advanced parties; headed by the Heir-Apparent in the one case, and the
Duke of Orleans in the other.</p>

<p><em>The Crown of England</em> is threatened in the upper compartment, and the
situation is typified as a Stag Hunt in the Park at Windsor. The Prince of
Wales, on horseback, is performing the part of huntsman, and his followers are
travestied as the Prince's pack of hounds&mdash;a favourite figure with the pictorial
satirists. Sheridan is the leading dog; the faces of Mrs. Fitzherbert, Burke, a
Bishop, and others, are distinguishable among the pack, which is harassing the
royal quarry.</p>

<p><em>The Crown of France</em> is endangered in a similar fashion. It will be remembered
that the stability of the government of Louis the Sixteenth received its
first shock from the Duke of Orleans, who, imitating the factious conduct of the
Prince of Wales at home, was in alliance with the enemies of the throne; in the
case of the Duke, with the Revolutionary parties of France.</p>

<p>The royal French Stag is run down at Versailles. The Duke of Orleans,
first Prince of the blood, is acting as whipper-in. He is dressed in a fantastic
habit of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le sport</i>, a compromise between a French postilion and a huntsman; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_275" id="Page_i_275">[275]</a></span>
is winding on his pack with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une corne de chasse</i>. The individuals constituting
the aristocratic French pack are described below the print, the names giving
some indication of the members of that Palais Royale clique of intriguers which
wrought so much evil to the reigning branch. Certain members of the Orleans
pack were destined to become notorious on the theatre of events which were
then impending over France.</p>

leaving his hermitage in the background (see <em>Public Characters</em>, 1806), is
journeying along one mile from Bath; the ex-Governor of Languard Fort is in

of Lord Jersey, above that of the <em>Hermit</em>. More particular reference to this
boar's head is made in the <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite>, 1761, pp. 34, 79.</p>

his writings, which gained him but equivocal fame; a bare axe, marked '<em>Gratitude</em>,'
is in his right hand; the Duke of <em>Marlboro's pistols</em> are in his belt; he has
a <em>Subscription Scheme, Gunpowder</em>, as a cartouche-box, and his foot is resting on
the <em>Vagrant Act</em>. Miss Ford (Mrs. Thicknesse), as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Beau Fidelle</i>, is following

<p><em>Introduction.</em>&mdash;'The following descriptive account of an excursion to
Brighthelmstone is intended to give those who have not visited that delightfully
situated town and its environs an idea of the pleasures with which a lively
and feeling mind will be impressed on viewing those scenes which the Authors
have endeavoured to illustrate.... Of the roads which lead to Brighthelmstone,
that immediately from London being most frequented, the Authors have
endeavoured to familiarise it to the traveller by pencil and pen.</p>

<p>'The various scenes which are introduced are slightly represented, and
intended merely to impress the mind with the general effects of nature. It is,
in short, a conversation narrative, illustrated occasionally with sketches of scenes
and incidents which seemed most worthy of notice.'</p>

<p>The plates were all drawn and etched by Rowlandson, and aquatinted by
Alken.</p>

<p>'The Marine Pavilion of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, on the west side
of the Steine, is a striking object, and admirably calculated for the summer
residence of a royal personage.... This Pavilion, correctly designed and
elegantly executed, was begun and completed in five months. The furniture
is adapted with great taste to the style of the building. The Grand Saloon is
beautifully decorated with paintings by <em>Rebecca</em>, executed in his best manner.
The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout ensemble</i> of the building is, in short, perfect harmony. The whole
was executed by Mr. Holland, under the immediate inspection and direction of
Mr. Weltj&eacute;, the Prince's German cook, who leased the property to his royal
master.'</p>

<p><i>About 1790.</i> <cite>Evening.</cite>&mdash;A small etching. A stout sportsman, lolling on his
pony, and followed by a miscellaneous tribe of dogs, has evidently been out
shooting, and on his homeward way he has fallen in with an encampment of
gipsies, who have pitched their tent beside a wood; three brawny nymphs are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_280" id="Page_i_280">[280]</a></span>
sitting about in easy attitudes, and a fourth, leaning on the stranger's horse, is
beguiling the Nimrod with her wiles; it seems probable, from the foolish expression
thrown into the rider's face, that he is likely to fall an easy victim into
mischievous hands.</p>

of a chamber at the fashionable marine resort. Three gentlemen are seated in
their combing-chairs; their hair is being curled and powdered by three hair-dressers.</p>

<p><i>October 20, 1790.</i> <cite>Four o'clock in Town.</cite> Designed and etched by Thomas
Rowlandson. Published by J. Jones.&mdash;This plate, which is entirely due to
Rowlandson's hand, is etched in outline, and filled in with aquatint, in imitation
of a faint drawing in Indian ink. A young and well-favoured military buck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_281" id="Page_i_281">[281]</a></span>
has returned to his house at the advanced and disreputable hour of four o'clock
in the morning, as indicated in the title; he has evidently been 'making a night
of it,' and is considerably the worse for his potations. His young and pretty
wife, who is in bed, is thrown into a mixed condition between consternation, fear,
and resentment at the condition of her gallant spouse; the husband is propped
up in an armchair, and left to the care of two comely housemaids, who are
making efforts to assist this hopeless rake to divest himself of his clothes&mdash;an
essential preliminary towards going to bed which he is signally unable to perform
for himself. He is perfectly helpless in the hands of these wenches, and
is contemplating with an imbecile air an empty purse, the result of his evening's
recreations. In spite of the somewhat suggestive nature of this subject, all the
figures are graceful and pleasingly expressed, and the faces are delicate and
attractive.</p>

<p><i>October 20, 1790.</i> <cite>Four o'clock in the Country.</cite> Designed and etched by
T. Rowlandson. Published by S. W. Fores, 3 Piccadilly.&mdash;The episode presented
in this picture is the complete reverse of that shown in the companion
plate, <cite>Four o'clock in Town</cite>. While the London rake is being assisted to his
late bed the country Nimrod is rising with the dawn. The enthusiast for the
chase has tumbled out of his early couch; his clothes are hastily thrown on in
the partial light of daybreak, and he is, while still half-asleep, making terrific
exertions to draw on his boots. His wife, who has not had time to commence
her toilette, and who, evidently, will resume her interrupted repose on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_282" id="Page_i_282">[282]</a></span>
departure of the hunting party, is standing, exactly as she has left her bed, with
a bottle of cordial and a glass, pouring out a nip of comfort to keep out the
cold, for the benefit of her sporting spouse. The chamber is alive with motion,
and it is evidently the accustomed method of departure; pairs of dogs are
rushing about, huntsmen and grooms are carrying saddles on their heads and
making preparations for the start. The remains of last night's relaxations, in the
shape of pipes and mugs of ale, are still uncleared; and the articles scattered
around, guns, saddles, whips, hunting-horns, and fox-skins, attest the pronounced
sporting tastes of the country squire. A pretty child is tranquilly sleeping, in
its cradle, undisturbed by the bustle of the hunter's early start.</p>

<a id="PROSPECT"></a><img src="images/i_303.jpg" width="600" height="396" alt="" />
<div class="caption">THE PROSPECT BEFORE US. NO. 1.</div>
</div>

<p><i>January 13, 1791.</i> <cite><a href="#PROSPECT">The Prospect before us</a>. No. 1. Humanely inscribed
to all those Professors of Music and Dancing whom the cap may fit.</cite> Published
by S. W. Fores, Piccadilly.&mdash;The possible future condition of the foreign artists
located within our shores, the performers at the Italian Opera, seems to have
provoked three large cartoons from Rowlandson's graver at the beginning of
1791. The straits to which these fashionable exotics, it was suggested, might be
reduced by the decaying state of the theatre in which they had been playing
are more particularly dwelt on in this and a later caricature. It appears it was
found necessary to close their house for restorations, which, if the state of things
hinted in <cite><a href="#CHAOS">Chaos is Come Again</a></cite> (February 4, 1791), may be considered in any way
prophetic, was resolved on none too soon. <cite>The Prospect before us</cite> evidently
offers the choice of two conditions. The first seems to have been an appeal to
the charitable, pending the construction of a new Opera House; the second, which
was accepted, being the conversion of the Pantheon into a theatre; a substitute
which in the end accidentally proved equally deplorable.</p>

<p>We first find the professors of music, singing, and dancing thrown on the
vicarious exercise of their talents as a wandering troupe round the town. The
model of the new house is borne as a plea to the benevolent, much on the
principle of the disabled sailors who, tramping the streets, singing and begging,
carried the model of their ship, to tempt the liberality of the almsgiving public.</p>

<p>A sweeper-lad is dropping a copper into the laced hat of one of the French
dancers, whose figure is probably intended for that of Didelot, one of the highest
paid and most popular performers in his walk on our stage. A butcher, with
evident sympathies for imported art, is compassionately dropping a bullock's
heart into the hat of an elderly artist, whose figure may possibly be intended for
that of old Vestris.</p>

<p>The tattered and reduced regiment of foreign performers are evidently not
prospering on their street perambulating campaign, since, judging from the
surroundings, they are reduced to solicit the patronage of the denizens of the
most squalid neighbourhoods. Their graces are displayed outside the premises
of one <em>Michael Nincompoop</em>, who, according to his notice-board, is engaged in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_286" id="Page_i_286">[286]</a></span>
somewhat miscellaneous line of trading, '<em>purveying, brickmaking, breeches, brandy-balls,
and all other kinds of sweetmeats</em>.' The circumstances of the Italian
Opera are more distinctly alluded to in a poster stuck on the wall, announcing:
'<em>A new Fantoccini this evening, called "Humbugallo in the Dumps." A dance
called "The Battle of the Brickbats;" to conclude with a grand crush by all the
performers.</em>'</p>

those Singers, Dancers, and Musical Professors who are fortunately engaged with
the Proprietor of the King's Theatre, at the Pantheon.</cite> Published by S. W. Fores.&mdash;Dismissing
the less fortunate artists whose services were not retained for the
new enterprise, we return to the subject of the opening of the Pantheon. In
anticipation of the success of this new Opera House, Rowlandson issued a large
cartoon representing a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d'&oelig;il</i> of the interior of the theatre, as seen from
the stage during the performance of a ballet. The Royal box, in the centre, is
tenanted by the King and Queen, and the boxes around are occupied by the
nobility and leaders of fashion. On the stage are Didelot and Madame Theodore,
dancing in the ballet of <em>Amphion and Thalia</em>. O'Reilly, in the orchestra,
is presiding over the band. The dancers, at this period, were the highest paid
performers in the company; with the leading artistes of the ballet were engaged
the vocalists Mara, Pacchierotti, Lazzarini, &amp;c., for the performance of operas.</p>

<p>The <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite> thus notices the privileged rehearsal which
preceded the regular <span class="locked">season:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>'Thursday, February 10, 1791.&mdash;This evening the Opera at the Pantheon
was opened to the subscribers, and a very elegant audience attended at the
rehearsal of the performance of <em>Armida</em>. Though none of the Royal Family
were present, a crowd of fashionable visitors exhibited patronage adequate to the
support of any undertaking.'</p>

<p><cite>European Magazine</cite>:&mdash;'February 17, 1791.&mdash;The new Opera House in the
Pantheon was opened with <em>Armida</em>, in which Pacchierotti, Mara, Lazzarini, &amp;c.,
distinguished themselves. Afterwards the ballet of <em>Amphion and Thalia</em> was
performed, with applause, by Didelot, Theodore, &amp;c.'</p>

<p>Another paragraph from the <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite> briefly relates the end of
this prosperous undertaking a year <span class="locked">later:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>'Saturday, January 14, 1792.&mdash;This morning, between one and two o'clock,
the painter's room in one of the new buildings which had been added to the
Pantheon, to enlarge it sufficiently for the performance of operas, was discovered
to be on fire. Before any engines were brought to the spot the fire had got to
such a height that all attempts to save the building were in vain. The fire kept
burning with great fury for about ten hours, by which time, the roof and part of
the walls having fallen in, it was so much subdued that all fears for the safety of
the surrounding houses were quieted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_287" id="Page_i_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>'The performers, next to the insurance offices, will be the greatest sufferers,
for they have put themselves, as usual, to great expense in preparing for the
season; many of them were obliged to do this upon credit; but their salaries
ending with the existence of the house, and before any of them had their benefit
nights, they have now no means of extricating themselves from their difficulties.'</p>

<p>We learn from the <cite>Memoirs of Henry Angelo</cite> that the author's father was
Master of the Ceremonies when the building was first opened for balls, &amp;c. We
quote a paragraph which well describes the final <span class="locked">calamity:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>'The Pantheon was certainly the most elegant and beautiful structure that
had been erected in the British metropolis. Shortly after the conflagration of
the Opera House in the Haymarket, in the year 1789, the proprietors of the
Pantheon, which had been deserted of late for Madame Corneilly's, in Soho, were
all put into high spirits, as proposals were made to construct a theatre in the
grand saloon there, and to transfer the performance of the Italian ballet and
opera to its stage. No theatre ever, perhaps, opened with greater <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&eacute;clat</i>. The
pit, boxes, and gallery were spacious, and magnificently fitted for the reception
of an audience. The stage was of vast extent, and no expense was spared to
render the scenic and the wardrobe department splendid and grand in proportion
to the spectacles announced. Their Majesties frequently visited this new theatre,
and everything was proceeding with advantage to all concerned, when within a
few months, one unfortunate night, this noble monument of the genius of Wyatt
was consumed by the same destructive element, and that great architect beheld
on the morrow, with indescribable grief, the entire ruin of that fond monument
of his youthful genius. The rising architects, too, were deprived of the most
beautiful model that modern art had yet produced for their study.'</p>

<p>The end of the Italian Opera performances, when the surveyors of Drury
Lane Theatre had come to the conclusion that the old building required to be
pulled down, is pictorially set forth by the artist in one scene of general collapse
and ruin. This print, for some undiscovered reason, is sometimes met without
the lettering; it was probably issued at the beginning of 1791 in that condition,
and then published later with a date, which rather interferes with its purpose or
intention, if it had not appeared earlier, since the prospects of the Opera company
were reassured by the conversion of Wyatt's famous Pantheon into a theatre
for their future use.</p>

inaugurated the adaptation of the magnificent and unfortunate monument in

<p>'Thursday, September 22, 1791.&mdash;The Drury Lane company performed in
the Opera House in the Haymarket. There was much clamour and some disturbance
at first, owing to some inconveniences attending the alterations in the
house, and chiefly the entrances, which, being soon got over, a scene was introduced
of Parnassus, which was painted and contrived in a very grand style; and
Messrs. Dignum and Sedgwick sung the air. The <cite>Haunted Tower</cite> then began;

<p><i>March 1, 1791.</i> <cite>The Attack.</cite> Published by S. W. Fores, 3 Piccadilly.&mdash;A
gentleman, who is driving four horses harnessed to a sort of curricle, with an
elegant and fashionably-dressed female by his side, is thrown into consternation
by the sudden apparition of a mounted knight of the road, who, seated on a high-mettled
steed, is presenting a pistol full at the driver. The traveller's servant,
dressed in his livery, and mounted on a cob, is brought up suddenly by the
stopping of his master's vehicle; his face indicates the greatest astonishment at
the demeanour of the highwayman and alarm at the unforeseen danger to which
his patron is exposed; it does not, however, occur to him to render any assistance.</p>

certain plans tied to his tail, and he is tearing off from the Duke of Portland's
mansion (the great rallying-place among the leaders of the Whig party); 'Sherry'
is escaping towards Carlton House, to take refuge with his new master; Fox is
clapping his hands to accelerate <em>Bardolph's</em> speed; the Duke of Portland is
throwing bundles of papers after the badgered fugitive; Burke is threatening him
with his <em>shelairy</em>; Lord Holland is aiming a stick at him, and a crowd of other
political celebrities belonging to the party are assisting to drive out the frightened
cur from their midst. In spite of his brilliant abilities Sheridan did not reflect
much credit on the party with which he had been allowed to ally himself. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_290" id="Page_i_290">[290]</a></span>
Prince of Wales, the good faith of whose allegiance was no less equivocal, finally
turned his back on his friends, while retaining the services of the <em>Bardolph</em> of
the picture. 'Sherry's' party had good cause to regard him with distrust.</p>

of this and the following political satires; there are several similar plates by
Kingsbury, who was working for W. Holland at this date, but, from certain
points in their execution, we are inclined to include one or two of these prints
with the series by Rowlandson. The Empress Catherine, in her 'Imperial
Stride,' has one foot resting on Russia, and the other touching the crescent above
the dome of St. Sophia, in Constantinople. The various sovereigns of Europe
are regarding this acrobatic performance with wonderment. Stanislaus the
Second is reflecting on the 'length to which power may be carried;' Pope Pius
the Sixth is declaring that 'he shall never forget it;' Charles the Fourth of Spain
is threatening that he will 'despoil the spoiler!' Louis the Sixteenth 'never saw
anything like it!' George the Third is saying, 'What, what, what a prodigious
expansion!' the Emperor Leopold the Second, is remarking that it is a 'wonderful
elevation!' and the Sultan, Selim the Third, is expressing his belief that 'all
Turkey would not satisfy the ambition of the Empress.'</p>

form their own impressions.</p>

<div class="caption">THE GRAND BATTLE BETWEEN THE FAMOUS ENGLISH COCK AND RUSSIAN HEN.</div>
</div>

<p>King George the Third and the Empress Catherine of Russia are matched
against one another in the great European cockpit for a decisive struggle&mdash;such
a conflict as has been imminent under nearly similar conditions at various emergencies
since 1791. The Great Powers are assembled to witness the encounter,
and are backing their respective champions. The Empress, who is game to
the last, is declaring, 'I have vanquished many a finer bird than you!' King
George is retorting, 'Boo, boo; bluster, bluster! won't leave you a feather!'
Queen Charlotte has a pile of money before her, which she is guarding from
straggling fingers; she is holding a laurel wreath&mdash;held out on the end of the
regal sceptre&mdash;over the head of her champion bird, and offering to wager 'a
million to ten thousand' on his chances of victory. The Lord Chancellor
Thurlow, who, although he was reckoned 'the wisest of men,' perpetually compromised
his prospects by his anxiety to make his own future secure, at the
sacrifice of consistency, is inclined to put his 'ratting' principles into practice:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_292" id="Page_i_292">[292]</a></span>
'She looks as if she wasn't afraid of any cock in Europe. I won't bet a penny!'
Pitt, seated beside his sovereign, is crying, 'I should like to have a bout with
her, but I'm afraid she'd soon do my business!' The King of Prussia has every
confidence in his champion: 'Two hundred thousand rix-dollars the cock wins!'
The Prince of Wales is entering into the sport: 'I wish they'd let my bird
encounter her; he'd soon lower her crest; ten thousand she turns tail!' The
Grand Seigneur is striking his Grand Vizier, and declaring to a female favourite
who is leaning over his shoulder, 'If the cock wins, by our holy Prophet, I swear
he shall be cherished in our seraglio as long as he lives!' The King of Spain
is remarking, 'It is easy to see by her spunk Potemkin has been her feeder!'
The Emperor of Austria's pocket-book seems empty. Catherine's favourite,
Potemkin, full of valorous confidence, is encouraging his Empress: 'A million
roubles she'll win! At him again, my dear mistress! Potemkin, your invincible
feeder, will back you to the last.' Louis the Sixteenth of France, whose crown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_293" id="Page_i_293">[293]</a></span>
has dwindled down to a mere trinket, is falling into raptures of admiration over the
Russian hen: 'I would give all that I have left of a crown for such a glorious bird!'</p>

new corsage seems to demand an enormous exertion of muscular vigour.</p>

<p><i>May 18, 1791.</i> <cite>A Little Bigger.</cite> (Companion print.)&mdash;The principal figure
in this plate is that of a corpulent individual, who is being measured by a meagre
whipper-snapper anatomy of a tailor; the girth of his portly client is giving the
knight of the needle no slight difficulty to surround his person with his measuring-tape,
and the customer is impressing on his tailor the necessity of leaving ample
room for his obese proportions.</p>

<p><i>August 12, 1791.</i> <cite><a href="#BARRACKS">English Barracks</a>.</cite> Aquatinted by T. Malton. Published
by S. W. Fores.&mdash;A view of the interior of a cavalry barracks, reproducing
a scene more properly indicative of domestic than of military life, although
weapons and accoutrements are scattered about. Drums and guns are piled in one
corner; at the window is a trooper <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en n&eacute;glig&eacute;</i> employed in brushing his uniform.
A woman is nursing a strapping boy, while a soldier at her side, in complete
uniform, is adjusting his helmet at the looking-glass. Another trooper has a
child in his arms, and is putting a lad, who is playing at soldiers, through
his musketry exercise; while a pretty maiden is presiding at the washing-tub.
An old grandmother, who is giving a playful infant a ride on her back, is pouring
out a glass of cordial for another warrior, whose toilette is far from complete.
Guns, sabres, military saddles, pistol-holsters, and other warlike objects are
hung on the wall, giving the apartment, which is otherwise blank enough, a
certain air of picturesque decoration.</p>

<p><i>August 12, 1791.</i> <cite>French Barracks.</cite> (Companion to the above.)&mdash;The
interior of a French barracks offers a perfect contrast to the simplicity and
decorous order which mark the occupants of an <cite>English Barracks</cite>. The
barrack-room is extensive, and handsomely decorated with trophies of weapons,
which, with a suit of mail, are disposed on the walls with a good eye to
effect. The officers are rising and dressing for morning parade. An officer,
the principal features of whose countenance are absorbed in a pair of huge
moustachios, is seated on the regimental drum, while a pretty girl is employed
unromantically in trimming the warrior's toenails. A soldier-barber is at the
same time dressing the hero's locks and binding up his monstrous pigtail, which
reaches over a yard in length&mdash;a standard of valour of protracted dimensions. A
lad is bringing this well-attended son of Mars his monstrous jack-boots, of a size
and weight to displace the great guns of his battery with considerable effect. All
these dandy warriors seem to be utterly dependent on the assistance of their
factotums; it is difficult to imagine these 'curled darlings' in connection with
gunpowder and a field of battle. A second officer is enveloped in his powdering-gown,
while his barber-valet is smothering him with volumes of violet-clouds
from his puffing apparatus. Another hero appears reluctant to abandon his
morning slumbers; he is seated, in his shirt, gaping frightfully, on the side of his
bed. One distinguished being has almost completed his elaborate toilette; the
due adjustment of his lace fall and cravat is engaging his exclusive attention;
he is standing in front of a large mirror to perform this delicate manipulation
with proper effect, and a very beautiful girl&mdash;whose own toilette is neglected, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_296" id="Page_i_296">[296]</a></span>
whose voluptuous charms are freely exposed&mdash;is holding a second glass at the
warrior's back, that he may be enabled to contemplate the reflection of his own
admired rear in the larger mirror; meanwhile one of his petty officers is standing
on the salute, ready to receive the orders of his chief. A pretty woman, a young
mother, is suckling an infant; and another child, whose wardrobe is limited to
a single garment, is, while eating breakfast, training a poodle to stand at ease
with a sword in his paw&mdash;a ridiculous parody of the warlike accompaniments
around.</p>

</div>

<p><i>October 28, 1791.</i> <cite><a href="#SLUGS">Slugs in a Sawpit</a>.</cite> Published by S. W. Fores, 3 Piccadilly.&mdash;A
brace of heroes, naval and military, are endeavouring to adjust
their differences by an appeal to arms; the combat, for the sake of retirement and
convenience, is taking place at the bottom of a sawpit. It seems that the duel
is of a most obstinate nature; three or four broken swords are strewn around;
and, honour not being yet satisfied, recourse has evidently been had to pistols,
several of which (some dismantled), with balls, &amp;c., are also thrown about on the
limited field of conflict. It seems the antagonists are most implacable, as, after
exchanging all these inconclusive passes and discharges, they are resorting finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_297" id="Page_i_297">[297]</a></span>
to the use of a pair of huge blunderbusses, about the dimensions of fieldpieces,
which would hold some pounds of slugs. The old Commodore is stooping his
fat body, and the military buck is resting on one knee, in order to get the
monstrous weapons into comfortable positions for firing; both combatants look
a trifle nervous, as the results are likely to be tolerably marked at such ranges;
the guns of the inveterate duellists are side by side, the stocks resting on their
respective shoulders and the muzzles just touching their noses. The consequences
likely to ensue on pulling the triggers can be easily imagined. A
workman has just arrived at the edge of his sawpit in time to discover the
trespasses these ferocious fire-eaters are making on his property.</p>

<p><i>November 22, 1791.</i> <cite>How to Escape Winning.</cite>&mdash;A pictorial satire directed
against a famous incident of the turf, which provoked an unusual amount of
attention and scandalous comments in proportion; the question never having
been satisfactorily disposed of, although it has been generally received that the
Prince of Wales, who owned the notorious racehorse <em>Escape</em>, was more sinned
against than sinning. It is sufficient to mention that the horse in question,
from certain circumstances which became a subject of vexed debate long after
the occurrence, did <em>not</em> win the race, when it was pretty evident, under fair
conditions of horse-racing, that he could have distanced every horse on the
course. In the print&mdash;which is the chief point we have to deal with&mdash;the race
is being run; the other jockeys are making great efforts to get ahead; the Prince's
jockey, Chiffney, on <em>Escape</em>, is holding in his mount; the horse is furious at the
restraint which is crippling him and preventing his running freely, the animal's
near fore-leg being secured to his off hind-leg with the owner's <em>Order of the
Garter</em>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">'Honi soit qui mal y pense.'</i> The figure of a sporting character, intended
either for that of the owner or trainer of this unlucky <em>Escape</em>, is standing with
his finger to his nose, an action implying that he has made it all right for himself.
In the distance the backers of the Prince's horse are either regarding the
owner with suspicion or are stamping with rage at the fraud by which they are
doomed to lose instead of winning their money.</p>

<p><i>November 22, 1791.</i> <cite>How to Escape Losing.</cite>&mdash;The principal figure is standing
in much the same style of 'knowing' attitude as that displayed in the previous
plate. The race is still being run; <em>Escape</em> is leading, the garter, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Qu'en pensez-vous</i>,
only remains attached to the near fore-leg; but the horse's chances are borne
down by heavy impediments; a pair of weights are slung over the jockey's
shoulders and other weights are suspended round the horse's neck and in front
of and behind his saddle.</p>

<p>1791. <cite>Angelo's Fencing Rooms.</cite> (From <cite>Reminiscences of Henry Angelo,
with Memoirs of his Friends, &amp;c.</cite>)&mdash;'For some years I had a fencing-room at the
Opera House, Haymarket, over the entrance of the pit-door. On the evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_298" id="Page_i_298">[298]</a></span>
of June 17, 1789, about eight o'clock, when in Berkeley Square, I saw a black
smoke ascending; and soon hearing that there was a fire in the Haymarket, I
directly hastened there, when, to my surprise, I beheld the Opera House in
flames. Having the key of my room in my pocket, and the crowd making way
for me, I soon got there, at the time the back part was burning. I first secured
the portrait of Monsieur Saint George (the famous fencer), which hung over
the chimneypiece and removed it to St. Alban's Street, where I then resided.
At my return, though I was not absent six minutes, the mob had rushed in and
plundered the room of everything. As to the foils, jackets, &amp;c., they were of
little value to me compared to what I had in my closet&mdash;a portfolio of beautiful
drawings, particularly several valuable ones of Cipriani, also of Mortimer,
Rowlandson, &amp;c., the loss of which I much regretted; but consoled myself by
saving Saint George's picture, which he sat purposely for and offered me, after
our fencing together, the second day of his arrival in the country. It was
painted by Brown, an American artist, much encouraged here at the time. The
last day of his sitting he dined at my father's, when, my mother enquiring of
him if it was a good likeness, he smiled and replied (he was a Creole), 'Oh,
madame, c'est si ressemblant <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">que c'est affreux</i>.' My room, which was in the front,
was the only one saved from the flames in the whole house; and fortunately, the
engines being placed in it, prevented the fire from communicating to Market
Lane.</p>

<p>'Sergeant Leger was an excellent fencer of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">première force</i>, whose elegant
figure and mildness of manners greatly influenced the amateurs of the science.
Though he was only in the ranks, his presence in every fencing-room was acceptable,
and when Saint George was his antagonist the match never failed to
excite attention.</p>

<p><cite>Fencing.</cite>&mdash;'In 1785 Monsieur Le Brun, a celebrated fencing-master now at
Paris, visited England. My academy in the Haymarket being then the general
rendezvous for all the foreigners who were either masters or amateurs of the
science, and near the coffee-house, their usual resort, he paid me a visit. I was
his first antagonist. I soon found out, as the pugilists call it, that he was a "good
customer" (a queer one to deal with); so much so, that, however I might have
distinguished myself before my scholars with the number of fencing-masters, &amp;c.
whom I have opposed, here I had nothing to boast of.</p>

<p>'I should observe that he was a left-handed fencer, and in full exercise in
Paris, and of course he must have been daily in the habit of fencing with many,
while in the course of years I might not meet with six of superior force.
Finding such an excellent competitor, and as I thought that it would be beneficial
to my scholars to accustom themselves to practise against a left-handed
fencer, I told him he would be welcome to us all.'</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_299" id="Page_i_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>Henry Angelo, who held the highest opinion of St. George, has drawn up
the following account of his <span class="locked">accomplishments:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>'The Chevalier de St. George was born at Gaudaloupe. He was the son
of M. de Boulogne, a rich planter in the colony. His mother was a negress,
and was known under the name of the "handsome Nanon;" she was justly considered
one of the finest women that Africa had ever sent to the plantations.
The Chevalier de St. George united in his own person the grace and the
features of his mother with the strength and firmness of M. de Boulogne.
No man ever united so much suppleness to so much strength. He excelled in
all the bodily exercises in which he engaged; an excellent swimmer and skater,
he has been frequently known to swim over the Seine with one arm, and to
surpass others by his agility upon its surface in the winter. He was a skilful
horseman and a remarkable shot&mdash;he rarely missed his aim, when his pistol was
once before the mark; his talents in music unfolded themselves rapidly: his
concertos, symphonies, quartettos, and some comic operas are the best proofs
of his extraordinary progress in music. Though he was very young he was at
the head of the concert of amateurs: he conducted the orchestras of Madame de
Montesson and the Marquis de Montalembert.</p>

<p>'But the art in which he surpassed all his contemporaries and predecessors
was fencing; no professor or amateur ever showed so much accuracy, such
strength, such length of lunge, and such quickness; his attacks were a perpetual
series of hits&mdash;his parade so close that it was in vain to attempt to touch him;
in short, he was all nerve.</p>

<p>'In the summer of the year 1787, on returning to my residence in St.
Alban's Street, I was surprised at the appearance of lights and a crowd of
people entering Mr. Rheda's fencing academy; on enquiry I was informed
that the Chevalier St. George had arrived in England, and was about to exhibit
his great talents at that place. I immediately went in and renewed my acquaintance
with him; and as it is customary for fencing-masters of celebrity
to engage with each other at such meetings, I proposed myself, and was accepted
as the first professor who engaged with him in this country.</p>

<p>'It may not be unworthy to remark that, from his being much taller, and
consequently possessing a greater length of lunge, I found I could not depend
upon my attacks with sufficient confidence unless I closed with him; the consequence
was, upon my adopting that measure, the hit which I gave was so
"palpable," that it "threw open his waistcoat," which so enraged him that, in his
fury, I received a blow from the <em>pommel</em> of the foil on my chin, the mark
of which I still retain as a <em>souvenir</em> of having engaged with the first fencer in
Europe.</p>

<p>'It may be remarked of this celebrated man, that although he might be considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_300" id="Page_i_300">[300]</a></span>
as a lion with a foil in his hand, yet, the contest over, he was as docile
as a lamb; for soon after the engagement, when seated to rest himself, he said
to me, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon cher ami, donnez-moi votre main, nous tirons tous les jours
ensemble.</i>"'</p>

<p>On leaving this country the Chevalier St. George presented Mr. Angelo
with his portrait by Mather Brown, his fencing-foil, glove, and jacket, which
were hung up in the rooms rented by Angelo over the Opera portico (Haymarket).</p>

<p>Among the competitors in these fencing assaults, which were patronised by
the Prince of Wales, and were sometimes held at Carlton House, are mentioned
the names of D'Eon, M. Fabian, M. Mag&eacute; (who was reckoned second to M.
St. George among the amateurs of Paris), M. Sainville, Mr. Rheda, Mr. Mola,
and Mr. Angelo, Sen.</p>

aquatinted by T. Malton.&mdash;<em>Dover, Deal, Margate, and Canterbury Coaches.</em>&mdash;Fires
at inns were by no means exceptional occurrences, if we may trust contemporary
novelists; and who could have seized the changeful scenes of life
flitting around them with such humour and fidelity as Fielding and the followers
of his genial, life-like school have arrived at? Their fictitious personages, as
Thackeray has argued, have often more vitality than those of actual history.</p>

<p>Everyone who was not content to live and die in one spot&mdash;the little space
whereon they were born&mdash;must, at one time or another, have given way to the
incentive of travel; all the world, high and low, aristocratic or mercantile, must,
in the course of journeys in the pursuit of pleasure, variety, scenery, health, gain,
or from necessity, from spot to spot, have encountered the humours of an inn;
since the slow-going waggon, or the inevitable 'machine,' which, in a later
generation, was supplanted by the flying stage-coach (itself, as judged by the
present system of transport, a very tedious, insupportable affair, according to
modern ideas&mdash;a serious and solitary means of travelling), and the various
eccentric methods of locomotion indulged in a century back, rendered frequent
'puttings up' at posting-houses in a measure unavoidable. A traveller in the
good old days when Fielding and Smollett noted down their pictures of life
was almost bound to meet adventures of one sort or another. There was the
excitement of the start, the difficulty of securing comfort in the article of seats,
and sociability in the way of companionship; the dangers of the environs of
London&mdash;the heaths, where the mail was always liable to be arrested at the wayward
will of the pleasant and popular Mr. Richard Turpin, on his equally well-bred
'Black Bess,' or at the hands and holsters of less famous and ruder professional
contemporaries; the risk of the roads; the digging of the great lumbering Noah's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_301" id="Page_i_301">[301]</a></span>
Ark from soft ways and quagmires; capsizing, or being snowed up, and such eventualities.
Bad roads, disagreeable comrades, a stuffy inside place, or a moist
outside 'shake-down,' were at intervals relieved by the arrival of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cort&eacute;ge</i> at
some hospitable hostelry, with its vast rambling galleries and its commodious
courtyard, where further adventures were not unlikely to attend the voyager.</p>

<p>The ardent house-warming prepared for the passengers at the <cite>Inn Yard on
Fire</cite> barely justifies the rapture of the rhymer. From the notice-board we find
the <em>Dover, Deal, Margate, and Canterbury Coaches</em> are advertised to set out
from the caravansary in question. The strangers are rudely disturbed, while the
flames are lapping the old building and serpentining their way round the inflammable
wooden balconies, as the suddenly awakened inmates take to flight
with such solitary articles as come first to hand. Peregrine is rescuing Emilia
much as Rowlandson has drawn that worthy in his illustration to the exciting
situation of the fire at an inn yard. (See <cite>The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_302" id="Page_i_302">[302]</a></span>
chapter xxvii.) A sufferer from gout is being conveyed in a wheelbarrow out
of imminent danger of roasting; an old dowager has appeared on the scene with
a pair of leather breeches to cover her shoulders, recalling similar episodes in La
Fontaine, Boccaccio, &amp;c.; while a corpulent old boy has simply thrown a lady's
quilted petticoat round his neck. A waggon and horses are being dragged out
of the dangerous vicinity. From its contiguity to the French route between
Dover and Calais the house is evidently frequented by foreigners lately landed
on our shores, and the unexpected warmth of their reception is too much for
the excitable Gauls. One Frenchman, an officer, is making good his escape;
his personal wardrobe is sacrificed, but he has secured his most precious belongings,
an umbrella, a sword, his jack-boots, and his wig and solitaire&mdash;wigs being in
those days somewhat costly appendages. A compatriot by his side is endeavouring
to make off with his worldly possessions, and is dragging a heavy portmanteau at
his heels; this salvage is endangered by the suspicions of a bulldog, who is not
to be shaken off; the animal is first stopping the box, and finally arresting the
fugitive by seizing his long <em>queue</em> in his mouth, a mode of arrest against which
the terrified <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Parlez-vous</i> is unequal and unable to defend himself. An antiquated
husband is holding a ladder for the escape of his pretty wife; the curmudgeon is
furious that the personal attractions of his better half should be thus displayed
to the less privileged males around, who are assisting her delicate descent.
The dangers of the fire are increased by the reckless impulse characteristic of
similar casualties, in which blazing objects are hurled out of window, spreading
the flames to places which have hitherto escaped ignition. Mirrors and tables,
sheets and other objects, are sent flying from the upper galleries on to the heads
of the scared travellers below. If the <cite>Squall in Hyde Park</cite> may be accepted
as an ordeal by water, the <cite><a href="#INN_YARD">Inn Yard on Fire</a></cite> must be acknowledged a most
appropriate pendant. These plates were, it is believed, issued as a pair. Both
are of one size, etched by Rowlandson, and aquatinted by T. Malton; the execution
is spirited as regards outline, and the tinting is most successfully and delicately
carried out. The second print, <cite>A Squall in Hyde Park</cite>, is, the Editor has reason
to believe, the scarcer of the two; a copy (proof) in the National Library, Paris,
and the one in his own collection, are the solitary examples with which he is
acquainted. The <cite><a href="#INN_YARD">Inn Yard on Fire</a></cite> is more familiarly known; and, although
original impressions command prices which are seemingly fabulous, several
impressions, of varying excellence, have come under the writer's attention.</p>

<p>1791. <cite>A Squall in Hyde Park.</cite> Drawn and etched by T. Rowlandson;
aquatinted by T. Malton.&mdash;The fashionable throngs which Rowlandson, with
his marvellously faithful pencil, has so often drawn, disporting themselves in the
paths of frivolity amidst the haunts of <em>the ton</em>, are viewed by him under a more
excited aspect. The promenaders, in a state of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sauve qui peut</i>,
are rushing off pellmell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_303" id="Page_i_303">[303]</a></span>
in an attempt to preserve their dripping finery from the effects of a sudden
thunderstorm. Doubtless <cite>A Squall in Hyde Park</cite> may occur frequently enough
in our day, but the artist who proposes to lend his graphic powers to delineate
the episodes of such a stampede in the present generation would not have his eye
for the picturesque gratified by the discovery of such grotesque elements as gratuitously
lent themselves to the appreciative caricaturist a century back. Rowlandson's
animated cartoon successfully includes all the diversities of the situation.
The park-gates are crowded by the sudden <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exeunt omnes</i>&mdash;pedestrians, horses,
and carriages are mixed in one confused mass in the struggle to escape from a
miniature tempest. Peers and pedagogues, the man of fashion in search of
gallant adventures, and the hypochondriac, limping parkwards to take the air;
the ignorant, new-fledged squire, the rustic dandy, whose head-dressing does not
extend beyond the powdered and frizzed peruke, and the man of knowledge and
philosophy, are thrown into violent contact, and unexpectedly realise whose
cranium is the hardest. The storm breaks, the black clouds gather and meet,
down pours a very torrent, and the wind suddenly takes to blowing 'big guns;'
hats, caps, and bonnets, wigs and head-gear generally, are sent flying off on
independent excursions; the sport of the sudden squall, to the dismay of the bereaved
owners; umbrellas of the period&mdash;still popular novelties, in substantiality
very different to their genteel descendants&mdash;are without exception blown inside-out;
feathers, which were worn of great height, splendour, and profusion, are
moistened and dripping like weeping willows. The Prince of Wales, in 'blue
and buff,' on horseback, followed by his groom, is pushing forward for Carlton
House; Lord Barrymore, in his lofty phaeton,
<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
has to exert all his charioteering
skill to restrain his terrified and plunging high-mettled steeds; while the fair
companion perched by his side, high over the heads of the humbler stream of
struggling humanity, is complacently enjoying the spectacle of the dilemmas
around her. Footmen are dripping; naval and military heroes are retreating;
such hats as have not been violently carried off are secured by handkerchiefs
tied under the chin, or held on by main force; petticoats are turned over shoulders.
The spectacle of confusion is fairly completed by an unfortunate slip, which has
left the person of the unhappy victim a stumbling-block for the general capsizing
of the hurried file which is following in his footsteps. A sturdy old admiral, in
an advanced stage of corpulence, is rather enjoying the opportunity, to which the
ruffling winds are contributing, of viewing the points of the dishevelled fair, and,
spyglass in eye, like his Grace the notorious Peer of Piccadilly, he is quizzing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_304" id="Page_i_304">[304]</a></span>
ankles and criticising the symmetry of the dainty belles before him; the long,
gauze-like, and limp drapery in multitudinous folds then in vogue being exceptionally
liable to come to grief under all such sinister emergencies. To add to
the terrors of the flight, a fierce bulldog, irritated with the general condition of
things, is taking exception to this universal attempt at escape, as indicating
suspicion to his faithful mind; he is making darts at the passengers, and it will
go hard with the fugitives he may take it into his head to arrest by the tension
of his formidable teeth.</p>

<p><i>January 1792.</i> <cite>St. James's&mdash;St. Giles's.</cite> H. Wigstead, invt. Published
by T. Rowlandson, Strand; and republished (1794) by S. W. Fores, 3 Piccadilly.&mdash;The
parish of <em>St. James's</em> is represented by two modish frail nymphs,
elegantly decked out in the Frenchified fashion of the period; their profuse
locks spread forth, frizzed and powdered, in the style imported from Paris by
Mrs. Fitzherbert; the refinement of their appearance ill accords with a bowl of
punch which they are convivially sharing. The ruder precincts of <em>St. Giles's</em>
are pictured in the persons of two coarse, overgrown females of the 'fishfag' and
'street ballad singing' order, swaggering with sufficient impudence to set the
universe at defiance.</p>

<p><i>February 22, 1792.</i> <cite>Work for Doctors' Commons.</cite> Published by T. Rowlandson,
Strand.&mdash;There is no evidence to prove this print directly proceeds
from the pencil of Rowlandson, but there are indications of his style, both in the
subject and in the execution; it is also in points suggestive of the early style of
Morland. A lady and a captain&mdash;a pretty pair&mdash;are dallying on a sofa, while
the superannuated lawful spouse of the frivolous fair one is ensconced behind a
screen, standing on a chair, and surveying the situation over the top of this ambuscade;
his footman is watching by his side, impressed as a witness, and is struck
with horror at the spectacle of domestic faithlessness, of which he is taking observations
through a peephole made through the screen for the purpose of spying.</p>

<p>From a MS. note to an impression which has come under the Editor's notice
it appears that the contemporary scandal relates to a certain Mrs. Walsh and
General Upton.</p>

<p><i>March 1792.</i> <cite>A Dutch Academy.</cite> Published by T. Rowlandson, 52
Strand, 1792.&mdash;The caricature represents, as the title describes, the interior of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_307" id="Page_i_307">[307]</a></span>
a drawing school in Holland; just such a one as may be found there to this day.
A corpulent <i lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">vrow</i> is sitting as a model to the painters, in an attitude more easy
than graceful. The Mynheers are clustered around, some of the students, most
of whom are advanced in life, and of clumsy, corpulently developed figures, are
seated on tubs, others are squatting on the floor, and nearly all are smoking. The
Dutchmen, who are of the conventional type&mdash;much as we find them pictured
in the veracious Knickerbocker's famous <cite>History of New York</cite>, closely encased
in buttoned-up jackets, and roomy nether garments&mdash;are plodding away at their
studies; some few are too interested to do anything beyond indulging in a stolid
contemplation of the charms of their material Venus.</p>

<p><i>April 1, 1792.</i> <cite>A Lying-in Visit, or a Short-sighted Mistake.</cite> Published by
S. W. Fores.&mdash;There are various versions of this subject, which it seems was
originally suggested by Newton. Several of his contemporaries have tried
their hand on it. A small version of the print is due to Rowlandson, and it
evidently found favour in its day. A purblind and antiquated spinster, decked out
in the very height of the fashion of the day&mdash;recalling the artist's suggestive <cite>Old
Ewe dressed Lamb Fashion</cite>&mdash;is supposed to have called on a visit of congratulation
to a young wife who has recently been deserving well of her country, by
increasing its population. An old footman, with a powdered head, is bringing in
a scuttle of coals; the gushing visitor, who was prepared to go into promiscuous
raptures in anticipation, is advancing to embrace the scuttle, which she imperfectly
distinguishes, fulsomely exclaiming to the consternation of John Thomas, who
is lost in <span class="locked">confusion:&mdash;</span>'O you pretty creature! Bless the dear baby, how it
smiles! Give it to me, Nurse! It has exactly its Papa's nose and Mama's eyes!
Oh, it is a delightful little creature!'</p>

<p><i>May 29, 1791&ndash;2.</i> <cite>Six Stages of Marring a Face&mdash;dedicated with respect to
the Duke of Hamilton.</cite> A companion to the <cite>Six Stages of mending a Face</cite>.&mdash;Stage
the first represents the prize fighter (in the days when pugilistic exhibitions
were specially given under the patronage of noblemen such as the Duke
of Hamilton), in all his muscular force, stripped for the contest, his face undisfigured
and manly, as left by nature; in stage the second, one eye is closed;
in stage the third he is much disfigured; in the latter stages the shape is entirely
beaten out of his features, until the champion is left, in stage the sixth, a hideous
mass of bruises, cuts, and bleeding wounds, hammered out of all resemblance to
his former self&mdash;a spectacle sufficiently revolting to act as an antidote to the
morbid excitement and attractiveness of the prize ring. It is worthy of remark
that the artist must have drawn this print, exposing the barbarity of the ring,
from sheer conviction founded on his own observations, and not from any
squeamish distaste for the sport; Rowlandson had enjoyed a wide experience
of athletic exercises, in which he was understood to excel, and attended numerous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_308" id="Page_i_308">[308]</a></span>
pugilistic encounters, amateur and professional, in his time; his pleasure in drawing
well-built figures, with the play of muscle which would be exhibited in the
course of 'bouts at fisticuffs' such as he had both the power and skill to delineate,
proves that he had a decided predilection for the science, apart from its reprehensible
brutalities. It further appears that the artist was somewhat of a boxer.</p>

<p><i>May 29, 1791&ndash;2.</i> <cite>Six Stages of Mending a Face. Dedicated with respect
to the Right Honorable Lady Archer.</cite> Published by S. W. Fores, 3 Piccadilly.&mdash;This
plate traces the progress of manufacturing a beauty <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la mode</i>. The first
stage introduces the fair one in a very dilapidated condition, and the materials
from which the lady is to be reconstructed do not seem promising. A handkerchief
is tied over her head to remedy the scarcity of hair; one eye is absent,
and the gums are toothless. A handsome glass eye is being adjusted in <cite>stage
the second</cite>. <cite>Stage the third</cite> represents the crowning of the shaven pate with
a luxuriant and fashionably dressed head of hair. An artificial set of teeth are
being placed in the lady's mouth in the next stage. The lady now approaches
an appearance of youth and beauty. In <cite>stage five</cite> she supplies the roses, hitherto
absent from her cheeks, with a hare's foot and rouge. <cite>Stage six</cite> pictures the
completed work, a dashing and captivating belle, with fine eyes (not necessarily
a perfect pair it is true), flowing, profuse, and becoming locks of hair, perfect
teeth, blooming complexion, and a carriage of conscious grace and coquetry.</p>

tremendous fire declare that the appearances exhibited through the windows,
the lofty scagliola pillars enveloped in flames and smoke, the costly damask
curtains waving from the rarefaction of the air, and the superb chandeliers
turning round from the same circumstance, together with the successive crashing
and falling in of different portions of the building, furnished to their minds a
more lively representation of Pandemonium than the imagination alone can
possibly supply. The effects too of the intense frost which then prevailed, on
the water poured from the engines upon the blazing pile, are described as equally
singular and magnificent.' J. B. Papworth.</p>

<p><cite>The Adventures of Roderick Random. Roderick Random is conducted by his
uncle Tom Bowling on a visit to his grandfather, the judge.</cite>&mdash;'After a few
minutes' pause we were admitted, and conducted to my grandfather's chamber
through a lane of my relations, who honoured me with very significant looks
as I passed along. When we came into the judge's presence, my uncle, after
two or three sea-bows, expressed himself in this manner. "Your servant&mdash;your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_309" id="Page_i_309">[309]</a></span>
servant. What cheer father? what cheer? I suppose you don't know me&mdash;mayhap
you don't. My name is Tom Bowling; and this here boy&mdash;you look
as if you did not know him neither&mdash;'tis like you mayn't. He's new rigged,
i' faith; his cloth don't shake in the wind so much as it wont to do. 'Tis my
nephew, d'ye see, Roderick Random&mdash;your own flesh and blood, old gentleman.
Don't lay astarn, you dog" (pulling me forward). My grandfather, who was
laid up with the gout, received his relation after his long absence with a coldness
of civility which was peculiar to him; told him he was glad to see him, and
desired him to sit down. "Thank ye, thank ye, sir, I had as lief stand," said
my uncle. "For my own part I desire nothing of you; but if you have any
conscience at all, do something for this poor boy, who has been used at a very
unchristian rate. Unchristian, do you call it? I am sure the Moors in Barbary
have more humanity than to leave their little ones to want. I would fain know
why my sister's son is more neglected than that there fair-weather Jack" (pointing
to the young squire, who, with the rest of my cousins, had followed us into
the room). "Is not he as near akin to you as the other? Is not he much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_310" id="Page_i_310">[310]</a></span>
handsomer, and better built than that great chucklehead? Come, come&mdash;consider,
old gentleman, you are going in a short time to give an account of your
evil actions. Remember the wrongs you did his father, and make all the satisfaction
in your power before it is too late. The least thing you can do is to
settle his father's portion on him." The young ladies who thought themselves
too much concerned to contain themselves any longer, set up their throats
altogether against my protector, "Scurvy companion&mdash;saucy tarpaulin&mdash;rude,
impertinent fellow&mdash;did he think he was going to prescribe to grandpapa? His
sister's brat had been too well taken care of; grandpapa was too just not to
make a difference between an unnatural, rebellious son and his dutiful loving
children, who took his advice in all things"&mdash;and such expressions were
vented against him with great violence, until the judge at length commanded
silence.</p>

</div>

<p><cite>The Adventures of Roderick Random. Chap. XI.</cite>&mdash;Roderick Random, and
his companion Strap, having alighted from the waggon, are standing a
little back in the best room of the Inn, where the landlord, candle in hand, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_311" id="Page_i_311">[311]</a></span>
receiving the rest of the guests, who are entering from the conveyance; Joey,
the honest driver of the waggon, is standing behind the obsequious Boniface.
Roderick Random thus pursues his <span class="locked">narrative:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>'Here I had an opportunity of viewing the passengers in order as they
entered. The first who appeared was a brisk airy girl about twenty years old,
with a silver laced hat on her head instead of a cap, a blue stuff riding-suit
trimmed with silver, very much tarnished, and a whip in her hand. After her
came limping an old man, with a worsted nightcap buttoned under his chin, and
a broad brimmed hat slouched over it, and an old rusty blue cloak tied about his
neck, under which appeared a brown surtout that covered a threadbare coat
and waistcoat, and, as we afterwards discerned, a dirty flannel jacket. His eyes
were hollow and bleared, his face was shrivelled into a thousand wrinkles, his
gums were destitute of teeth, his nose sharp and drooping, his chin peaked and
prominent, so that when he mumped or spoke, they approached one another
like a pair of nutcrackers; he supported himself on an ivory headed cane, and
his whole figure was a just emblem of winter, famine, and avarice. But how
was I surprised when I beheld the formidable captain in the shape of a little
thin creature, about the age of forty, with a long withered visage very much
resembling that of a baboon, through the upper part of which two little grey
eyes peeped: he wore his own hair in a queue that reached to his rump, which
immoderate length I suppose was the occasion of a baldness that appeared on
the crown of his head, when he deigned to take off his hat, which was very much
of the size and cock of Pistol's. Having laid aside his great coat, I could not
help admiring the extraordinary make of this man of war: he was about five
feet and three inches high, sixteen inches of which went to his face and long
scraggy neck; his thighs were about six inches in length, his legs resembling
spindles or drumsticks, two feet and a half, and his body, which put me in mind
of extension without substance, engrossed the remainder, so that on the whole
he appeared like a spider or grasshopper erect, and was almost a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vox et præterea
nihil</i>. His dress consisted of a frock of what is called bear-skin, the skirts of
which were about half a foot long, an hussar waistcoat, scarlet breeches reaching
halfway down his thighs, worsted stockings rolled up almost to his groin, and
shoes with wooden heels at least two inches high; he carried a sword very near
as long as himself in one hand, and with the other conducted his lady, who
seemed to be a woman of his own age, and still retained some remains of a handsome
person; but so ridiculously affected that, had I not been a novice in the
world, I might have easily perceived in her the deplorable vanity and second-hand
airs of a lady's woman.'</p>

<em>Signed G. L. S.</em>&mdash;As this print exhibits various indications of Rowlandson's
handiwork, it has been thought advisable to include it amongst the present
selection. The plate represents the general upset of affairs in France. On
the wreck of a number of columns marked <em>Humanity</em>, <em>Social Happiness</em>,
<em>Security</em>, <em>Tranquillity</em>, <em>Domestic Peace</em>, <em>Laws</em>, <em>Order</em>, <em>Religion</em>, <em>Urbanity</em>,
&amp;c., is balanced the seat of the republic of France, or rather that of Paris.
A Fury yelling <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ça ira</i> represents <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La R&eacute;publique</i>; in her hand is a picture of
<em>Religious Indifference</em> graphically set forth as an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">auto da fè</i> of Papish Bishops
and Cardinals. <em>Plenty</em> is represented by a Fury extending her cornucopia of
'Assignats' to a group of hungry-looking half-starved Frenchmen. <em>Peace</em> is
displayed firing a bomb marked <em>Abolition of Offensive War</em>; the gun carriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_313" id="Page_i_313">[313]</a></span>
is inscribed <em>Universal Benevolence</em>; the Goddess of Order is blowing through a
trumpet the tidings, <em>Peace of Europe established</em>.</p>

<p><cite>Equality</cite> is travestied as an aristocrat kneeling in the dust, while a half-naked
sansculotte is treading on his neck and beating his head with a club. <cite>Liberty</cite>
is shown as a Jacobin, trampling on the Law, and holding the head of a Conventionalist
on a dagger, to which the rulers of the state are compelled to bow
their obeisance. <cite>Humanity</cite> is parodied by a female monster holding up the
heart of a martyr to the new religion.</p>

<p>1792. <cite>Cold Broth and Calamity.</cite>&mdash;This print has the reputation of being
an unusually successful example of the artist's humorous powers of delineation,
and the writer has seen several original designs on the same subject by
Rowlandson's hand; in some cases the drawings are larger and more important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_314" id="Page_i_314">[314]</a></span>
in character than the etching of <cite>Cold Broth and Calamity</cite>; the subject seems to
have been a favourite one.</p>

<p>The scene represents the waters of one of the parks, or of a frozen river; in
the foreground is a scene of grotesque confusion, the ice has given way, and a
party of skaters have fallen through; heads, arms, and skate-bound feet are
waving over the hole, through which a group of unfortunates are engulphed. A
little distance off the face of another unfortunate is thrust through a hole in the
ice, wigless, and wearing the sort of alarm one could conceive under the circumstances;
while further on half a face, with a wig and pig-tail attached, is visible,
the owner of which is evidently shouting for assistance. Other skaters are disporting
themselves in the distance; they, too, are getting themselves into difficulties.
A stout parsonic-looking personage, in a full-bottomed wig, is falling
forward, with the certainty of his body breaking through the ice: the upset of
this capacious individual will involve a skater who is following him closely,
whose hat and wig have already flown away from him. A party of snug old
gentlemen in top-boots and ample great-coats are enjoying the sufferings of
their fellow-creatures, comfortably on the banks, and in the distance is seen a
large tent for the accommodation of visitors.</p>

etched by T. Rowlandson; published by S. W. Fores, 3 Piccadilly.</p>

<span class="i0">The Mind distemper'd&mdash;say, what potent charm,</span>
<span class="i0">Can Fancy's spectre&mdash;brooding rage disarm?</span>
<span class="i0">Physic's prescriptive art assails in vain</span>

</div></div></div>

<p>The <cite>Hypochondriac</cite>, forming a companion to <cite><a href="#AGUE">Ague and Fever</a></cite> (See March
29, 1788), is another instance of the difficulty of attempting to express mental
and physical maladies by pictorial embodiments, the designer being one of
the ingenious amateurs of the period, who had recourse to more experienced
professional hands to work their conceptions into presentable shape, with, at
least, some regard for the accepted ideas of form, and a certain respect for the
technicalities of execution. The <cite>Hypochondriac</cite> is seated in his arm-chair, in
night-cap and slippers, and wrapped in a flannel dressing-gown, his arms are
folded, and his head droops, in melancholy meditation, on his chest; the expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_316" id="Page_i_316">[316]</a></span>
of his features is moody in the extreme. By his side is an iron-clamped chest,
to hint that the sufferer is somewhat tenacious of his wealth, although his life has
otherwise become insupportably burdensome. Phantoms, and figurative horrors
of various descriptions, are haunting the invalid's diseased mind. There is a
dagger, like the sword of Damocles, trembling above his head. A grim skeleton
of Death is, with grotesque energy, threatening to hurl his dart, as a release
from life's fretful calamities. A corpse, with grave-clothes clinging to its ghastly
frame, is proffering the means of making an untimely exit, by a rope or a pistol
at choice; another phantom figure is setting the example of plunging headlong
down to destruction; a goblin is offering a cup of poison; while a spectre, wearing
the sufferer's own image, is suggesting on his fictitious person the ease of cutting
his throat. A hand with a drawn sword, a ghostly hearse, and heads of
Medusa-like description, with furies, fates, &amp;c., appear for the purpose of
daunting the unsettled brain of the haunted <em>Hypochondriac</em>. A table is covered
with <em>Doctor's Stuff</em>, and a well-fed and prosperous charlatan, in attendance on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_317" id="Page_i_317">[317]</a></span>
the distempered patient, is in consultation with a pretty waiting-maid, whose face
and person give indications of the most flourishing health&mdash;a palpable contrast to
the sufferer on whom she is retained to attend.</p>

Published by J. Brown, 2 Adelphi.&mdash;<cite>Reform Advised</cite>: John Bull, in his comfortable
easy chair, and wearing the homely and decent clothes of a well-to-do
citizen, is seated beside his substantial fare of good roast beef and plum pudding,
with his mug of 'home-brewed.' Three of the French reformers are taking
compassion upon his peaceful ignorance; they have come over from Paris expressly
to convert him to the advantages of the new order of things. These
tatterdemalions are hungry, ragged, and by no means prepossessing as regards
their exteriors; and, while John Bull is attributing his comforts to 'the blessed
effects of a good constitution,' the sansculottes are taking considerable pains to
bring him to a contrary conviction. The leader is offering him the cap of liberty
and tricolor, and asserting: 'I am your friend, John Bull: you want a reform;'
his followers declare, 'My honourable friend speaks my sentiments;' and 'John
Bull, you are too fat!'</p>

<p><cite>Reform Begun</cite> discovers John Bull under altered circumstances; his broadcloth
is all in tatters, he has a wooden leg, and is shoeless; in his hand is a frog,
which he despairs of relishing: 'A pretty Reform, indeed; you have deprived
me of my leg, and given me nothing but frogs to eat; I shall be starved; I am
no Frenchman!' His three philosopher friends now wear a more threatening
aspect, and are menacing John Bull with bludgeons and daggers; one is crying:
'Eat it, you dog, and hold your tongue: you are very happy.' The
others are adding: 'That's right, my friend, we will make him happier still!'
and 'He is a little leaner now!'</p>

<p><cite>Reform Complete</cite> shows the national prototype thrown to the ground, and
quite powerless under the results of the new <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">r&eacute;gime</i>: 'Oh, oh! French fraternity!'
he is groaning, while the Reformers, flourishing their flaming incendiary
torches, are dancing on his prostrate body: 'Oh, delightful! you may thank me,
you dog, for sparing your life&mdash;thank me, I say!' 'Now he is quite happy&mdash;I
will have a jump!'</p>

This print appeared originally in 1792.&mdash;The conception of the plate
is due to Henry Wigstead, the Bow Street magistrate, to whom as a friend
and travelling companion of Rowlandson, a merry wit, and one of the congenial
spirits of his day, several references have been made in the course of this work.
The grandpapa is evidently enraptured with his infantine descendant, for whose
diversion he is going through certain ludicrous antics; the venerable gentleman's
tongue is not, as at first glance it would appear, lolling out in idiotic contortions:
it is a lump of sugar which he is holding between his teeth to divert the infant;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_323" id="Page_i_323">[323]</a></span>

volunteer and militia movements were pushed forward with enthusiasm
in 1794, it being generally believed that the French might attempt a descent on
our shores at any moment, and the loyally disposed were determined that they
would not be taken either unawares or unprepared. Abundant materials were
offered for the sallies of the satirists: the training and equipment of this new
army of defence presented a sufficiency of comic incidents; we find Bunbury,
Gillray, Woodward, and Rowlandson, burlesquing the rustic cavalry; in the
present plate a number of farmers and helpers, mounted on cart horses and
armed with blunderbusses, flails, pitchforks, &amp;c., are horrifying their officer by
executing an impromptu charge upon a peaceful farmyard, knocking down old
ladies, scattering the poultry, shooting the pigeons, capsizing labourers into wells,
and producing an effect of universal confusion and dismay.</p>

Uncle, who is a sufferer from gout, is evidently a well-to-do personage; and
the attentions of his relatives, who are favouring the sufferer with a visit of condolence,
are, it appears, suggested by self-interest. One of the highly considerate
relations seems good-naturedly assisting the invalid by making his will, while a
pretty young damsel is embarrassing their interesting connection with a tender
embrace, and altogether the members of the party are evidently set upon promoting
their own prospects with a view to a division of the estate.</p>

<p>This print, which is aquatinted by F. Jukes, has been described as Hogarthian
in type; it was issued with a companion plate executed under similar auspices,

various representative pillars of commerce present are expressive of profound
depression and distress. The individual oddities of such an assemblage are
characteristically dealt with; the grouping is good, and the faces, costumes, and
movements of the figures are hit off with the felicity which more particularly
belonged to Rowlandson's graver.</p>

<h2><a name="d1796" id="d1796"></a>1796.</h2>


<p>1796. <cite>Sir Alan Gardiner, Covent Garden.</cite>&mdash;'<em>Weeds carefully Eradicated
and Venomous Reptiles destroyed&mdash;By Royal patent. God save the King!</em>'&mdash;This
print bears the name of Kingsbury, and it may be considered out of place in a
work treating of Rowlandson's productions; as, however, the traces of the latter
artist's handiwork are easily distinguishable, while the resemblance the plate
offers to the known etchings after Kingsbury are less distinctive, it is
probable that the execution, at least, is due to the skill of our caricaturist.</p>

<p>Sir Alan Gardiner was elected Member of Parliament for Westminster, June
1796. The naval hero, as represented in the engraving, is dressed in his
uniform, supplemented with a gardener's apron; he is reaping the Republican
crop with his 'Sickle of Loyalty,' while protesting his patriotism: 'My life and
services are ever devoted to my King and country.' Britannia with her buckler
is encouraging the admiral, and crowning her gallant son with a laurel wreath&mdash;'Go
on, Britannia approves, and will protect you!' In the distance is shown
Gardiner's ship <em>The Queen</em> with the words, <em>First of June</em>, inscribed on her flag.
The admiral is slicing off the head of the Whigs; Fox is declaring: 'I was always
a staunch friend to the crops and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sansculottes</i>, but this damned crop is quite
unexpected.'</p>

<p>John Horne Tooke, represented as a reptile, is being swept up by the rake
of the Fiend in person; he is crying, 'Now will no prospering virtue gall my
jaundiced eye, nor people fostered by a beloved sovereign and defended by the
wisdom of his counsellors. To anarchy and confusion I will blow my <em>Horne</em>,
and wallow in everything that's damnable!'</p>

<p>The Evil One has already secured the head of Thelwall in his clutches&mdash;'This
will not <em>Tell well</em>.' Hardy is groaning, 'I was always Fool-<em>Hardy</em>.'
The Devil is congratulating the captured Horne Tooke&mdash;'Long looked for
come at last, and welcome, thou staunch friend and faithful servant, enter thou
into the hot bed prepared for thee!'</p>

<p>We find a drawing by Rowlandson dated November, 1796, caricaturing the
figures of three very eminent personages in conference, the Lord Chamberlain
(Lord Salisbury), the King of Würtemburg&mdash;who had come over to this country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_328" id="Page_i_328">[328]</a></span>
on a high matrimonial mission, to marry the Princess Royal&mdash;and the Duke of
Gloucester, playfully described by the satirists, on account of his slimness, as a
'slice of single Gloucester.' These portraits, which are very spirited, and full
of character, are drawn on the back of another sketch, the first suggestions, in
Rowlandson's clear and effective outline, for the cartoons of 'John Bull going to
the wars' and 'John Bull's victorious return,' the best known version of which
was issued by Gillray. (<cite>John Bull's Progress.</cite> Published June 3, 1793.)</p>

<p><i>May 5, 1796.</i> <cite>General Complaint.</cite> Published by S. W. Fores.&mdash;The credit
of this invention is due to Isaac Cruikshank, the father of the great caricaturist,
but Rowlandson certainly had a hand in the execution of one version. The
print represents a dissatisfied hero, whose dolorous portrait is described by the
title; his head occupies the major part of his trunk, and he is not in that respect
unlike the figurative impersonations of the potent and universally familiar
<em>Nobody</em>. In one hand he is holding out his empty purse; in the other is the
<em>London Gazette</em>; one sheet is filled with <em>Bankruptcies</em>, and the rest is devoted
to fresh unpopular exactions to meet the requirements of the Budget. The
people were generally weary of the war, and dissatisfied with the high prices and
the decline of commerce brought in its wake. The ministers in power were
not liked, and the generals, officers, and those who had the conduct of military
affairs, were regarded with undisguised distrust; suspicions and grumblings
against the administration were rife and outspoken, and in short the conduct
of affairs was pretty unanimously voted disastrous for England, and discouraging
as to her future. There was, according to the critics and satirists, but one
popular headpiece, and he was easily to be recognised as <em>General Complaint</em>.</p>

<p>1797. <cite>A Theatrical Candidate.</cite> (<cite>Vide Kelley's Memoirs.</cite>)&mdash;Sheridan, in his
managerial chair, is seated before his business table, on which is spread a long
and discouraging statement, setting forth those bugbears of 'Sherry's' tranquillity&mdash;a
list of 'unpaid salaries,' 'proprietor's demands,' 'Chancery proceedings,' and
other applications for money. Letters from authors: <em>Sir, do you ever mean to
pay me for my Tragedy? &amp;c.</em> Beneath the sly manager's seat is perceived, 'pit
money,' 'renter's shares,' and his own particular <em>Art of Humbug</em>. A most
unpresentable candidate for dramatic honours is standing confronting the great
man; according to a placard on the wall, this quotation from <em>Hamlet</em> is applied
to the ungainly applicant, 'Oh, there be players that I have seen play, and heard
others praise&mdash;and that highly (not to speak it profanely)&mdash;that neither having
the accent of Christian, nor the gait of Christian, Pagan, nor man, have so strutted
and bellowed, that I have thought some of nature's journeymen had made men,
and not made them well: they imitated humanity so abominably.'</p>

<p>"A candidate for the stage lately applied to the manager of Drury Lane
Theatre for an engagement. After he had exhibited specimens of his various
talents, the following dialogue took <span class="locked">place:&mdash;</span>'Sir, you stutter;' 'So did Mrs.
Inchbald.' 'You are lame of a leg;' 'So was Toote.' 'You are knock-kneed;'
'So is Wroughton.' 'You have a <span class="locked">d&mdash;&mdash;d</span> ugly face;' 'So had Weston.' 'You
are very short;' 'So was Garrick.' 'You squint abominably;' 'So does Lewis.'
'You are a mere monotonous mannerist;' 'So is Kemble.' 'You are but a
miserable copy of Kemble;' 'So is Barrymore.' 'You have a perpetual whine;'
'So has Pope.' 'In comedy you are quite a buffoon;' 'So is Bannister.' 'You
sing as ill as you act;' 'So does Kelly.' 'But you have all those defects combined;'
'So much the more singular.'"</p>

buildings; the appearance of these edifices, a hundred years ago, differed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_331" id="Page_i_331">[331]</a></span>
but slightly from their present aspects; the view is enlivened with crowds of
Dutchmen, Jews, vrows, &amp;c., variously occupied; all the humours and activities
of the scene have been seized and improved on by the artist with his characteristic
vigour and animation. The architectural portions of Rowlandson's
Dutch and Flemish views are worked out with care and attention, and with an
easy skill, strongly suggesting Prout's studies from similar picturesque materials.</p>

<p>'From the Lion d'Or at Antwerp,' writes Angelo in his <cite>Reminiscences</cite>, 'I
rambled about the town; the next day I saw the grand church, where the curious
representation of Purgatory is exhibited, and the Place de Mer, which, as well as
the view of the Stadthouse at Amsterdam, has been so accurately designed by
Rowlandson (published by Ackermann) when on a tour in Holland with Mr.
Mitchell, late partner in Hodsoll's (the banker's) house.'</p>

<p><i>August 1797.</i> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tiens bien ton Bonnet, et toi, defends ta Queue. Rollandson
inv.</i> P. W. Tomkins sculp.&mdash;The plate which bears this title is somewhat
of an enigma, especially as regards the orthography of the artist's name,
which must have been generally familiar in 1797. The style of engraving, more
pretty than powerful, a combination of delicate line and stipple, removes it still
further from the recognised characteristics of Rowlandson's works; and the
extreme finish and smallness of the method employed have produced a somewhat
hard and laboured result, such as one does not expect to find in engravings
by or after this artist.</p>

<p>The subject is revolutionary; an aristocrat, one of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeunesse dor&eacute;e</i> order,
and one of the mob, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonnet rouge</i>, are in active conflict. The two estates have
come into collision; the representative of social refinement is tall, elegant, well-favoured,
and scrupulously attired, in the advanced fashion of the hour; his
opponent is shambling, misshapen, uncombed, wretchedly clad, and with his
ragged shirt open at the front and exposing his chest. The hero of the curled
and scented locks has had the temerity to seize the red bonnet of Liberty, which
is the only pretension to finery indulged in by the ruffian; in return, the strong
hand of the latter is entwined in the clubbed tail of the dandy, and a significant
warning is given him to take off that cherished appendage&mdash;shaving a <em>queue</em> and
cutting off a head by Mère Guillotine, the barber of the aristocrats, being sometimes
synonymous terms during the reign of the Jacobins.</p>

<p>It was in the spring of this year (1797) that a duty was proposed in England
on hats, an impost the people avoided by wearing caps: the satirists intimated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_332" id="Page_i_332">[332]</a></span>
the danger that similar taxes would end in driving John Bull to adopt the
republican habits of our neighbours, and, among other allusions, Gillray published
a plate (April 5th, 1797) under the title of <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Bonnet Rouge</span>, or John Bull
evading the Hat Tax</cite>, in which the national prototype is shown trying on the
famous red bonnet of the Jacobin section.</p>

<p><i>January 12, 1798.</i> <em>The Dinner.</em> Published by J. Harris, Sweeting's Alley,
Cornhill, and 8 Broad Street.&mdash;This plate forms one of a series of important
size (21 × 17) executed by Rowlandson in a bold and spirited manner; the plate
is dated 1787, and was issued in 1798.</p>

<p>The set, it is certain, was deservedly popular in those famous fox-hunting
days, and doubtless the five best known subjects have graced the walls of
many fine mansions, the owners of which inclined to the sports of the chase;
indeed, this hunting series may be found in grand old country houses, much
prized, and preserved to the present day, although too frequently the prints are
found discoloured by time from the effects of having been varnished.</p>

<p>The <em>Hunt Dinner</em> pictures the wind-up of a successful day's sport. The
table has been cleared, punch bowls are introduced, the run has been recorded
and canvassed, and the venerable ancestral hall, hung with the armour of an
earlier generation of the occupant's progenitors, is ringing with the sounds of
hilarity. The young squire, a man of mettle, has mounted a chair in front of
the portrait of his sire, who it seems was a Nimrod in his day: field sports
are obviously the family taste; the owner of the estate, standing at the head of
the table to pledge a toast, and holding a huge prize cup, in which Reynard's brush
is dipped, is waving his cap, and giving a 'View Halloo!' which is inspiring his
guests, the bold hunters gathered round his mahogany, who are acknowledging
his lead with an enthusiasm and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entraînement</i> which correspond to the ardour of
their host; the bumpers are lifted on high with reckless hands, and numerous pairs
of stentorian lungs are echoing the challenge with boundless goodwill; in some
instances the good cheer is a trifle overwhelming, and one hero, though capsized
in his chair, is still doing honour, with undiminished rapture, to the toast of
the evening: even the privileged hounds are adding their voices to the general
hilarity.</p>

<span class="i0">Our trade is encouraged as much, if not more,</span>
<span class="i0">By the tender soft sex I shall ever adore;</span>
<span class="i0">But their husbands, those brutes, have been known to complain,</span>
<span class="i0">And swear they will never set foot here again.</span>
<span class="i0">Ye wretches ingrate! To find fault with your wives,</span>
<span class="i0">The comfort, the solace, and joy of your lives;</span>
<span class="i0">Oh! that women, whose price is so far above rubies,</span>
<span class="i0">Should fall to the lot of such ignorant boobies!</span>
<span class="i0">Doesn't Solomon speak of such women with rapture,</span>
<span class="i0">In verse the eleventh and thirty-first chapter?</span>
<span class="i0">And surely that wise King of Israel knew</span>
<span class="i0">What belonged to a woman much better than you!</span>
<span class="i0">He says, 'If you find out a virtuous wife,</span>
<span class="i0">She will do a man good all the days of her life;</span>
<span class="i0">She deals like a merchant, she sitteth up late.'</span>
<span class="i0">And you'll find it is written in verse twenty-eight,</span>
<span class="i0">Her husband is sure to be known at the gate:</span>
<span class="i0">He never hath need or occasion for spoil,</span>
<span class="i0">When his wife is much better employ'd all the while;</span>
<span class="i0">She seeketh fine wool, and fine linen she buys,</span>
<span class="i0">And is clothed in purple and scarlet likewise.</span>
<span class="i0">Now, pray, don't your wives do the very same thing,</span>
<span class="i0">And follow th' advice of that worthy old king?</span>
<span class="i0">Do they spare for expenses themselves in adorning?</span>
<span class="i0">Don't they go about buying fine things all the morning?</span>
<span class="i0">And at cards all the night take the trouble to play,</span>
<span class="i0">To get back the money they spent in the day?</span>
<span class="i0">But these to their husbands more profit can yield,</span>
<span class="i0">And are much like a lily that grows in the field;</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_343" id="Page_i_343">[343]</a></span>
<span class="i0">They toil not, indeed, nor, indeed, do they spin,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet they never are idle when once they begin,</span>
<span class="i0">But are very intent on increasing their store,</span>
<span class="i0">And always keep shuffling and cutting for more.</span>
<span class="i0">Industrious creatures! that make it a rule</span>
<span class="i0">To secure half the fish, while they <em>manage</em> the pool;</span>
<span class="i0">Methinks I should like to excel in a trade</span>
<span class="i0">By which such a number their fortunes have made.</span>
<span class="i0">I've heard of a wise, philosophical Jew,</span>
<span class="i0">That shuffles the cards in a manner that's new;</span>
<span class="i0">One Jonas, I think; and could wish for the future</span>
<span class="i0">To have that illustrious sage for my tutor;</span>
<span class="i0">And the Captain, whose kindness I ne'er can forget,</span>

<p><i>November 12, 1798.</i> <cite>High Fun for John Bull, or the Republicans put to
their last shift.</cite> Published by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.&mdash;The victory gained
by Nelson at Aboukir Bay, over the combined fleets, disconcerted the French
enthusiasts and restored confidence at home; it was recognised that while
English admirals could sweep their enemies from the seas, neither the dangers of
invasion, nor the difficulties of contending with France, need be ranked of much
consequence. In the print, John Bull is enjoying the <em>High Fun</em> of setting his
opponents to equip fresh fleets, in order that his sailors may carry them off
captive as trophies. A <em>Dutch Oven</em> is serving as the bakery, Mynheer is pushing
in a fresh batch of war frigates; 'Donder and Blaxan to dis fraternisation,
instead of smoking mine pipes, and sacking de gold, dis French broders make
me build ships, dat Mynheer Jan Bull may have the fun to take dem.' The
Spaniard, with a tray of big guns, is faring no better under fraternisation. 'How!
that Nelson wit one arm and eye can take our ships by dozens, then vat shall we
do against the autres, wid two arms and eyes? day will have two dozen at a time.'
The Frenchmen are excited over their prospects; the head baker has a fine
batch ready for the oven: 'Sacredieu, Citoyens, make a haste wit one autre
fleet, den we will show you how to make one grande Invasion;' the journeyman
is working at his kneading tub, which contains such ingredients for fresh fleets
as, <em>Ruination, Botheration, Confiscation, Requisition, Plunderation, Limitation,
Execution, Constitution, Fraternisation, Naturalisation, Expedition, Abolition,
Cut-throatation, and Damnation</em>. The assistant is not hopeful: 'By Gat, well
you may talk, make haste, when that English Nelson take our ships by
the douzaine!' John Bull, whip in hand, is laughing with satisfaction: 'What!
you could not find that out before, you stupid dupes, but since you began the
fun you shall keep on&mdash;so work away, dam ye, else Jack Tar will soon be idle.'
Jack Tar is seen hopping off with a full load of ships; his spirits are excellent:
'Push on, keep moving, I'll soon come for another cargo; Old England for ever,
huzza!'</p>

<p>1798. <cite>The Discovery.</cite> Republished 1800, 1808&ndash;9, &amp;c.&mdash;A bed-chamber is
the scene of the discovery; a young couple have been surprised by a corpulent
old gentleman, who is threatening a kneeling and simple-looking youth with a

Destroyed, January 1, 1799, to the confusion of its Affiliated Friends.</cite> Published
for the <cite>Anti-Jacobin Review</cite>, by T. Whittle, Peterborough Court, Fleet Street.&mdash;The
Tory party at the beginning of 1799 (the parliamentary session had
opened at the end of November 1788) endeavoured to stifle the Opposition by
raising outcries against sedition, and by denouncing publications of a revolutionary
tendency, with which they pretended to implicate the Whigs. On the
strength of certain alarmist tracts, extraordinary measures were taken to restrain
the liberty of the press, and a few months later, in July, the Ministry went so far
as to put into effect the extreme measure of subjecting printing presses to a licence.
The organs of the Tories, exulting in the discomfiture of their opponents, were
continually urging increased and severer political persecutions, while they pretended
that the members of the Opposition were, in despair of succeeding
in preserving their party by fair means, identifying themselves with the more
treasonable writers, and were laying secret trains for the destruction of the
Constitution. The King's Bench, Newgate, and Coldbath Fields began to be
crowded with political prisoners, the last-mentioned receiving the popular nickname
of <em>the Bastille</em>. The <cite>Anti-Jacobin Review</cite> was, as usual, peculiarly smart
at the expense of the malcontents, and Rowlandson's assistance was enlisted to
prepare a cartoon which, it was supposed, would expose the Whigs in their true
colours, and hold up the abettors of sedition to the execration of all loyal
subjects.</p>

<p>There are four elements displayed in this general view of the fancied emergency:
the supernatural department, headed by the arch-fiend in person; the
Radical pamphleteers and so-called workers of treason; the prominent members
of the disconcerted Opposition and their followers; and the King and his
ministers displayed, as Olympians, in the clouds. The Infernal Influence is
superintending the preparation of the charm, which Horne Tooke and his friends,
as the witches in Macbeth, are working at a boiling cauldron; the nature of the
component parts of the conjuration are thus set <span class="locked">forth:&mdash;</span></p>

</div>

<p>One of Horne Tooke's colleagues is working the incantation from a breviary of
his own, 'Lying, False Swearing, &amp;c.,' and is flourishing a witch's besom, 'Thrice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_359" id="Page_i_359">[359]</a></span>
the Gallic wolves have bayed!' Another of the weird sisterhood is stirring the
unholy mixture, crying: 'Thrice! and twice King's Heads have fallen!'
Horne Tooke is attending to the fuel department; he is muttering: ''Tis time,
'tis time, 'tis time!' The witches' familiars are whirling above their heads, and in
the midst of the flames from the cauldron, in the shape of wild cats, with wings; a
flying monkey, with 'Voltaire' on his collar; a tiger with vulture wings, marked
Robespierre; and Dr. Price's little dog, which is even more remarkable than the
animal associated with the early magicians, are the ministering imps. The
fiend, with his pitch-fork, and attended by dragons, serpents, Cerberus, and
other terrific monsters of an imaginative construction, suggestive of Callot's
grotesques, is directing as head cook the Democratic philter-workers to</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>The inflammable materials, which are piled up to make the pot boil, and fanned
into flames by a diabolical news-boy, from the <em>Courier</em>, consist of such combustibles
as <em>O'Connor's Manifesto</em>; <em>Oakley's Pyrology</em>; <em>Belsham's History</em>;
<em>Rights of Nature</em>; <em>Quigley's Dying Speech</em>; <em>Freud's Atheism</em>; <em>Whig Club</em>;
<em>Universal Equality</em>; <em>Darwin's topsey-turvey Plants and Animals' Destruction</em>;
<em>Sedition</em>; <em>French Freedom</em>; <em>Political Liberty</em>; <em>Duty of Insurrection</em>; <em>Equality</em>;
<em>Fraud</em>; <em>Sophisms</em>; <em>Blasphemy</em>; <em>Heresy</em>; <em>Deism</em>, together with such fiery sentiments
as <em>Kings can do no good</em>; <em>Joel Barlow</em>; <em>Resistance is Prudence</em>; <em>The
Vipers of Monarchy and Aristocracy will soon be strangled by the infant Democracy</em>;
<em>Kings are Servants</em>, <em>&amp;c.</em>; with the <em>Analytical Review</em>, a rival publication,
thrown in as <em>Fallen never to rise again</em>.</p>

<p>The Duke of Bedford is at the head of the Opposition; the members seem
to fare badly between the two extremes of Pittites and Radicals, the leader is
demanding: 'Where are they! Gone. Pocketed the Church and Poorlands!
The Tythes next!' The Duke of Norfolk is deploring the 'Fallen Sovereignty
(of the People). Degraded Counsellor!' having been deprived of some of his
offices as a punishment for the famous toast. Lord Derby is equally hopeless:
'Poor Joe is done. No Test, no Corporation Acts.' Fox, who had kept his
word and absented himself from the debates, is reduced to a tattered state, and
enquires: 'Where can I hide my secluded head?' Erskine, in legal trim, as
'Counsellor Ego,' is deploring: 'Ah, woe is me&mdash;poor I!' Tierney is regretting
his past activity: 'Would I had never spoke of the licentiousness of the press!'
Sir Francis Burdett, who had brought an investigation into the abuses practised
on the unfortunates in the New State prison, before the House, a motion founded
on his own observations, is enquiring: 'What can I report to my friends at the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bastille</i>?' Thelwall, with his lectures under his arm, is 'Off to Monmouthshire;'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_360" id="Page_i_360">[360]</a></span>
and the followers of the dispirited 'party' are wandering blindly, lost in the
'Cave of Despair.'</p>

<p>Above the clouds is the King as Jupiter, with his supporters; light is being
poured down in streams, upon the machinations of the disaffected patriots, from
a symbolical source: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Afflavit Deus et Dissipantur</i>. 'Your Destruction cometh
as a whirlwind!' 'Vengeance is ripe!' The monarch is strangling a brace
of serpents, and asserting, 'Our enemies are confounded!' One minister is
offering congratulations on a 'Great Victory!' while Pitt, behind the Crown, is
insinuating an expeditious method of disposing of his adversaries: 'Suspend their
bodies.' The Lord Chancellor, careful of the forms of law, is suggesting a more
formal mode of procedure: 'Take them to the King's Bench and Coldbath
Fields!'</p>

<p><i>February 10, 1799.</i> <cite>An Artist Travelling in Wales.</cite> Rowlandson delin.,
Mercke sculp. Published by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.&mdash;The caricaturist&mdash;in
company with his friend, Henry Wigstead, himself a bit of an artist, further
given to sportive flirtation with the Muses&mdash;visited North and South Wales in
August 1797, for the purpose of carrying out a picturesque tour, to which the
two travellers furnished the accompaniments of descriptive sketches and sketchy
descriptions. The journey was undertaken solely as a pleasure trip, and not
carried out with the intention of 'making a book.' It seems, however, that the
interest which partial friends took in the notes of scenery, as found in Rowlandson's
sketch-books, and in the minutes of travel, as jotted down in Wigstead's
journal, finally prevailed over the travellers' reluctance to make much of a little;
and accordingly, some two years later, the <cite>Remarks on a Tour to North and
South Wales</cite> were submitted to the public, in the form of an octavo book, with
some additional views by the hands of Pugh, Howitt, &amp;c. (See 1800.)</p>

<p>Rowlandson appears both to have enjoyed this excursion, and to have been
able to turn his opportunities to good account. He made several characteristic
landscape sketches, and the present writer possesses a few drawings, in various
stages of progress, which were evidently commenced on the spot.</p>

<p>A more Rowlandsonian relic of the tour is preserved in the plate, <cite>An Artist
Travelling in Wales</cite>, first published soon after the traveller's return to town.
Who the artist so represented may be the writer is not prepared to assert; but,
as caricaturists have a well-recognised habit of turning not only the figures of
their friends, but their own persons, to satiric usages on occasions, it is suggested
that the large and gaunt limner, with his strongly-outlined features, and with his
long legs slung across a Welch pony, may offer some points of resemblance to
the designer; it is evident that more than once (See <cite>The Chamber of Genius</cite>,
April 2, 1812) Rowlandson has burlesqued his own figure, or made himself the
hero of equivocal situations, much as artists who have lived in our times have,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_361" id="Page_i_361">[361]</a></span>
now and again, delighted to introduce their own features amidst the fictitious
personages they have thought proper or have been called upon to introduce.
Notably in the cases of Thackeray and Cruickshank, this whimsical <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">penchant</i> is of
such frequent occurrence, that the student, curious in tracing out such eccentricities
of genius, will be able to discover at least a dozen characteristic and intentional
resemblances of those admirable masters scattered over their illustrations, and
relating to various periods of their careers.</p>

<p>It may be that remembrances of his old master at the Academy, Richard
Wilson, who held the office of Librarian when the waggish youth, Rowlandson,
was a student at the Academy, floated through the artist's mind in the course of
his Welsh peregrinations, and tempted him to combine points of personality
peculiar to both. It was not the first time Rowley's pencil had taken liberties
with the marked traits of 'Red-nosed Dick,' who died, it must be conceded,
some fifteen years before the tour in question. At all events, Peter Pindar, the
witty and vituperative, was one of Rowlandson's intimates, and his advice to
landscape-painters in general and to his friend and chum, Richard Wilson, in
particular, whose talents he had the daring to lavishly acknowledge in the face
of a generation which treated the artist with cold neglect because, forsooth, his
works were 'not fashionable,' should appropriately be engraved below Rowlandson's
unflattering <span class="locked">presentation:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Claude painted in the open air.</span>
<span class="i0">Therefore to Wales at once repair,</span>
<span class="i2">Where scenes of true magnificence you'll find;</span>

<span class="i0">You'll have with creditors no <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>;</span>

<span class="i0">Who hunt you with what noise they may,</span>
<span class="i0">Must hunt for needles in a stack of hay.</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>A view in Wales is faithfully pictured; the unsophisticated natives are struck
with astonishment at the figure of the travelling artist, whose profession they are
far from comprehending, and whose paraphernalia excite their wonder. Rain,
which is not unknown in the Principality, is wrapping landscape and figures in
a moist embrace. The artist's very remarkable umbrella is a poor protection;
his hat is limp; for safety his long clay pipe, a luxury difficult to replace, is thrust
through a slit in the flap; his lank locks are dripping; the moisture is concentrating,
and dropping down his well-defined proboscis. Of course it was necessary,
in such an expedition, to bear the baggage and incidental impedimenta. A box
contains the artist's larder and wardrobe; his saddle-bags hold the provisions of
the hour; beside him swing his tea-kettle and coffee-pot; his goodly sketch-book
is slung across his back, much as the observant traveller may have seen canvasses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_362" id="Page_i_362">[362]</a></span>
strapped across the shoulders of pedestrian artists during the season, and in the
vicinity of Bettews, Conway and the Lluwy in our day. The easel is folded up&mdash;and
a vastly unwieldy affair it is&mdash;on the back of the stumpy pony; brushes, a
palette, knife, flasks of oil of goodly proportions, and a palette of extensive dimensions,
are attached to the animal's neck; and thus equipped, the man of paint
and his rough steed are picking a devious way through the saturating moisture,
up and down the steep mountains of the country: a pleasant souvenir of past
hardships and discomforts by the way.</p>

<p><i>March 1, 1799.</i> <cite><a href="#HOWL">An Irish Howl</a>.</cite> Published for the <cite>Anti-Jacobin Review</cite> by
T. Whittle, Peterborough Court, Fleet Street.&mdash;The month following, the Irish
patriots, and rebels alike, were favoured with a view of their position, which was
hardly more encouraging than the pictorial prospect held out for the enlightenment
of the Democrats at home. A National Convention is supposed to have been assembled;
the members are thrown into consternation; and the table, round which
they have been deliberating over the concoction of their organ the <cite>United Irishmen</cite>,
is upset. A diabolical visitation is sufficient to account for this confusion. A
monstrous representative of the Fiend of Evil, with formidable horns and claws,
bearing a pitchfork over his shoulder, and with the French cap of Liberty,
labelled <em>Anarchy</em>, on his brow, is intruding on the scene, with a masterpiece
of his own preparation, setting forth the tender fate which the Irish patriots were
likely to meet at the hands of their allies the Jacobins. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Tableau Parlant</i>
affects to portray an 'Irish Stew, a favourite dish for French Palates.' The
sons of Erin are, according to the canvas, thrust into a 'Revolutionary Pot,'
which is boiling over a fierce fire; certain Jacobin French cooks, wearing the
caps of Liberty, are thrusting their betrayed disciples into the seething cauldron,
'<em>Equality</em>, all to be stewed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</i>,' while another apostle of Freedom is clapping
on the lid: 'Liberty of being stewed!' The Arch-Deceiver, thrusting out
a forked tongue, is imparting his instructions: 'Stew it well; it cannot be overdone
for you and me!'</p>

<p>The United Irishmen are variously affected with despair at the probable end
of their plottings. One patriot, intended for Grattan, or O'Connor, is exclaiming,
'My merits with the Republic should have saved me; but I find we must all
stew together!' A ragged Reformer is thrown on his back; a bundle of pikes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_364" id="Page_i_364">[364]</a></span>
are at his feet; a case of <em>Radical Reform</em>. A papist friar is crying: 'By St.
Patrick, a complete Catholic emancipation.' Others of the party are crushed. A
legal gentleman is moaning in despair: 'So much for Republicanism and glorious
independence! No money! No lawyer!' His neighbour cries: 'I now howl
in vain; we are all gone to pot!' Another patriot is thinking regretfully of
Ireland's proper and natural ally: 'Brother John would not have treated us so!
What your own O'Connor, too!' The Map of Ireland is dragged to pieces,
and dismantled by flying devils and imps of mischief christened 'Tallien, Barras,
Lepaux,' &amp;c. One of the united brethren is turning his eyes on the pitiful end
of the Green Isle: 'Poor Erin, how thou'rt torn to pieces by these five
harpies!'</p>

<p>1799. <cite>An Etching after Raphael Urbinas.</cite> An example of Rowlandson's
powerful renderings of studies after the old masters, executed in a bold and
flowing manner.&mdash;The nude figure of a man, who has probably been sleeping at
the foot of a tree, has suddenly unfolded his cloak and found himself confronted
by a hissing serpent, which has raised itself on its tail in readiness to attack the
unprepared victim, whose face is made to wear an expression of statuesque horror.
A club is on the ground at the feet of the man.</p>

<p><cite>Apollo, Lyra and Daphne.</cite> Frontispiece probably to a book of music.&mdash;Apollo,
with his crook and shepherd's dog by his side, and with sheep at his
feet, is seated at the entrance to a wood. Several musical instruments, bound
together with ribands, are hung on the branch of a tree over his head. On
the other side of the picture is a nymph in classic guise, evidently captivated
with his harmonies; she is resting her hand on the shoulder of a second listening
maiden, dressed as a shepherdess.</p>

than when engaged in perpetuating the comicalities which he noticed in the country;
rustic simplicity, the pretensions of inflated noodles, bumptious nobodies, and
kindred absurdities, such as are displayed in 'The procession of a Country Corporation,'
wherein the Aldermen and Mace-bearers, his worship the Mayor, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_368" id="Page_i_368">[368]</a></span>
his chain, and his dignified deportment, and his following of puffed-up provincial
big-wigs are shown filing in solemn state past the pump, the Town-hall, and the
stocks, to the Church vestry; the country clodhoppers and honest children of
the soil are gazing open-mouthed, over-awed by the impressive nature of the
ceremony, and the solemn airs of the performers. Bathos is arrived at in a
notice on the wall, past which these 'hogs in harness' are strutting&mdash;'Ordered
by the Mayor and Corporation that no pigs be suffered to walk the streets.
For every offence the penalty of five shillings!'</p>

of Orange to his states are represented landing in the Texel, and delivering the
Dutch from the hands of their friends the Sansculottes. Mynheer has become
wretched and ragged under the French r&eacute;gime; he is shaking a British tar by
the hand, heartily delighted to see a chance of recovering his <span class="locked">freedom:&mdash;</span>'Ah,
Mynheer Bull, these cursed French rats have gnawed us to the backbone; they
have barely left us a pipe, a drop of Hollands, or a red herring; oh, what a
pretty pickle have we brought ourselves into!' 'Well, Mynheer,' responds Jack
Tar, 'you seem heartily sick of fraternity: had you stuck to your old friends
instead of embracing your ragged relations, you might have kept your gilders,
saved your breeches, and preserved both states and stadtholder.' A Dutch
vrow is trampling her foot upon an order of the French <span class="locked">Convention:&mdash;</span>'If any
Dutch woman be detected in concealing any part of her husband's private property,
she shall be guillotined.' She has secured a trifling comfort, a bottle of
'Hollands gin.' 'I have had great trouble, Mynheer, to smuggle this bottle for
you, those French ragamuffins search me so close!' The troops forming the
English contingent are landing from their ships, and driving the French legions
before them at the point of the bayonet; the apostles of Liberty are losing
their requisitions, 'Ducats and gilders for the use of the municipality;' they
despair of converting their invaders: 'Here be dese English Bull dog, dey

<p><i>October 28, 1799.</i> <cite>A Note of Hand.</cite> Designed by G. M. Woodward.
Etched by Rowlandson. Published by R. Ackermann.&mdash;From Bunbury to
Woodward the change is easy. In all these renderings of the designs of less
skilful amateurs it must be remembered that Rowlandson's part was not limited
to that of a mere copyist of their ideas; he had to put crude conceptions into
a presentable shape, and in most instances he has added points which originated
in his own invention, and, as far as execution is concerned, he has made
the works mainly his own.</p>

<p>In the present caricature there is actually no indication of Woodward's
handiwork; a smart sailor of the period, returning to shore with prize money
galore, and a watch, chain, and seals in either fob, neat silver shoe-buckles, and
a spic-span rig-out, is calling to cash a twenty-pound note on a banker, who is
negligently looking at the ceiling. The honest tar, who probably thinks the
amount of the draft he has to draw a veritable fortune, is evincing his consideration
for the man of finance&mdash;'I say, my tight little fellow, I've brought you a
Tickler! A draught for twenty pounds, that's all! But don't be downhearted,
you shan't stop on my account! I'll give you two days to consider of it.'</p>

<p>1799 (?). <cite>Legerdemain.</cite>&mdash;The subject owes its invention to the observant
humour of Henry Bunbury, the caricaturist of gentle birth, who was ever a
friendly ally of Rowlandson; while the latter has lent his more trained skill to
work out the conceptions of the flattered amateur, further regarded, according to
the views of his contemporaries, as his distinguished patron. We are introduced in
'Legerdemain,' to the consulting room and operating surgery of certain rustic
practitioners, who combine the twin professions of dentists and pedicures; teeth
and corns being extracted promiscuously, as the requirements of their patients
might necessitate. Strength, rather than skill, is the chief requisition, if we
may trust the whimsicalities of 'Legerdemain,' where main force directs the
operations of the performers. One sturdy tooth drawer is bringing his knee
and all the brute power at his command to bear in the way of leverage on the
refractory grinder of an unfortunate and distracted client; a hammer and a pair
of coarse pincers do not argue well for the painless dentistry of the establishment.
A squire, judging from the liveried servant in attendance, is submitting his
foot to another professor, for the removal of an obstinate corn; the victim is
thrown into paroxysms of agony by the forcible mode of procedure adopted:
the rude chiropedist has seized the sufferer's foot securely under his arm, and is
dragging away with such vigour that, if the corn will not be persuaded to come
off decently, the toe will be dragged out by the roots&mdash;the latter a most undeniable
method of permanent cure so far as corns are concerned.</p>

Woodward del. Etched by Rowlandson. Published by R. Ackermann, 101
Strand.&mdash;The fortunate possessor of that dubious vehicle, 'a Bankrupt cart,' is
proceeding in state past his own premises with his chin in the air; the showy
wife of his bosom in feathers and finery is riding by his side, and their children
are packed in sandwich fashion. A follower, who is probably a drayman, put
into livery for the occasion, and mounted on one of the horses used in the
business, is grinning at the high and mighty dignity assumed by his employers.
A news boy is blowing his horn in the averted faces of the party, offering the
<cite>London Gazette</cite>, which contains the objectionable black list of bankruptcies,
wherein, it is hinted, the name of 'Mash, Brewer,' figures conspicuously. Puddle
Dock is the scene of this exposure, and the brewery is posted with advertisements,

<p>1799 (?). <cite>A Freshwater Salute.</cite>&mdash;The occupants of two waterside crafts
are exchanging courtesies on the river, a more frequent occurrence at the beginning
of the century, when figures of speech, especially among 'waterside
loafers,' were more forcible than refined. The boatmen in the respective
wherries are bawling at one another, and a stout damsel is extending, in expressive
pantomime, an invitation which has shocked the proprieties of the occupants
of the other craft, a lady of <em>ton</em> in a gay hat and feathers, and a very prim
old gentleman, who is looking perfectly rigid with horror and indignation.</p>

Esq., Riding Master to that authority on equestrianism, the Doge of Venice. It is
a question which are the more extraordinary animals, the mounted citizens or
their horses; all is grotesque and burlesque. Of course fat men are shown
tumbling off and over their steeds; and with equal propriety, a brook is introduced,
in which to deposit the unfortunate leapers. Various curs have come
out to share the run, and among the most spirited riders may be distinguished
a brace of black chimney-sweeps, fraternally perched astride the single donkey
possessed by the firm.</p>

<p>1799 (?). <cite>Cits airing themselves on Sunday.</cite> H. Bunbury del., Rowlandson
sculp.&mdash;A lady and gentleman are enjoying an equestrian promenade, too
busily engaged in flirting to notice that their horses are riding over some wandering
pigs. A Jew is in a chaise, taking his pleasure in the air; the fair Jewess,
his wife, is driving, the rest of their family are by their side. A stout elderly
volunteer in his uniform is out for exercise and relaxation, mounted on a heavy
horse from the cart, ridden with blinkers.</p>

<p>1799 (?). <cite>A Militia Meeting.</cite>&mdash;The original suggestion for this subject,
which bears Rowlandson's name, is, with several other small etchings, belonging
to the same series, due to Henry Bunbury; it represents a 'justice's parlour,'
filled with local magnates, who are seated in council on the momentous militia
question. The characteristics of the various personages are individualised with
the sense of humour and that power of hitting off quaint expressions with which
both Bunbury and Rowlandson were gifted in the highest degree.</p>

<p>1799 (?). <cite>A Grinning Match.</cite>&mdash;The companion print to <cite>A Militia Meeting</cite>,
executed under the same auspices. A party of rustics, whose rude features are
more rudely burlesqued, are grouped around a barrel to assist at a competitive
exhibition of 'face-making.' The challenge runs thus: 'A gold ring to be
grinned for; the frightfullest grinner to be the winner.' Mounted on a tub is
one of the champions, round his head is the traditional setting of a horse collar,
and he is succeeding in making the most fearful grimaces, to the consequent
delight of the spectators.</p>

<p>1799 (?). <cite><a href="#DISTRESS">Distress</a></cite>, (18 inches by 12<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>,) <cite>from an Original Drawing by Thomas
Rowlandson</cite>.&mdash;Published by Thomas Palser, Surrey side, Westminster Bridge.&mdash;That
Rowlandson possessed a remarkable power of grasping the humorous side
of life was generally acknowledged in his own day, and is now well established,
time having confirmed the justness of his title to a lasting reputation; indeed, his
works in this order have long received a recognition which is more assured
than has been accorded to those of his contemporaries. It may, however, be
pointed out, with equal sincerity, that his conception of the terrible is even more
remarkable than his facility for expressing the whimsical frivolities of society.
It would be difficult to find a more realistic representation of the horrors of
shipwreck than the appalling scene pictured under the title of 'Distress.' The
fearful sufferings of the survivors, exposed without sustenance to the dangers of
the deep, and the hopelessness of any chance of rescue, are all simply set forth
with intense feeling, and a faithful perception of the horrors of the situation
which is harrowing to examine, although it is evident that the terrors of the
subject must have exercised a certain fascination over the mind of the delineator.
It seems clear that portions of a crew have escaped the loss of their vessel only
to become the powerless victims of more insupportable sufferings. A solitary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i_374" id="Page_i_374">[374]</a></span>
officer and several of the crew are crowded into a boat, which they have no means
of properly navigating. Provisions and water are evidently wanting; the horizon
is a blank, the sea is still running high, and the sky threatens further tempests.
Hunger, thirst, and exposure, are reducing the ocean waifs to madmen; while
some are in paroxysms, others are stiffening corpses, and the body of one
sufferer is about to be cast into the waters to lighten the freight; some are sunk
in blank indifference or imbecile despair; others are furious, one or two are
looking for help from above, and a few, among them the young officer and the
boatswain, are doing their best to steer the open and over-laden boat towards a
likely course. The cabin boy's distress is rendered with peculiar pathos.</p>

<p>1799. <cite>Hungarian and Highland Broadsword Exercise.</cite> Twenty-four plates,
designed and etched by Thomas Rowlandson, under the direction of Messrs. H.
Angelo and Son, Fencing-masters to the Light Horse Volunteers of London
and Westminster. Dedicated to Colonel Herries. Oblong folio. London.
Published, as the Act directs, February 12, 1799, by H. Angelo, Curzon Street,
Mayfair.&mdash;Engraved Title and Frontispiece. A tablet topped by the figure
of Fame and supported by a relievo representing Guards on the march; below
it a trophy, and the escutcheon of the corps. On either side an archway or
portico, with relievo tablets above, representing military scenes. On guard and
saluting, on the left, is a Light Horse Volunteer of London and Westminster;
on the right is one of the same corps dismounted, presenting arms. The
etchings are dated September 1, 1798. The subjects are executed with considerable
dash and spirit. The major part of the plates represent movements of
cavalry, depicted with knowledge and power; instead of being, as the titles of
the illustrations would indicate, mere definitions of the positions assumed in the
exercises, the artist has, with superior ingenuity and ability, managed to produce
a lively series of military tableaux filled with appropriate actions, in which bodies
of troops, reviews, incidents of war, engagements of large parties, assaults,
repulses, and other military demonstrations, make up the backgrounds, and
convert a set of plates of mere broadsword exercises into an animated and interesting
collection of warlike pictures. Judging from the lengthy subscription list
appended to the folio, these plates must have enjoyed a wide popularity, secured
under the auspices of the Angelos, whose acquaintances amongst the fashionable
world enabled them to obtain a satisfactory array of patrons and subscribers.</p>

<p>The subjects are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="list">
<li>    Prepare to guard.</li>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> The artist's name frequently occurs upon his plates as his own publisher, and, as might be
anticipated, the prints produced under this sponsorship are invariably of his most popular description.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> The original sketches of this series were recently bequeathed to the South Kensington Museum,
where they are attributed to Bunbury: a contemporary advertisement (1786) announces the designs
to the forthcoming <cite>Journal of a Tour in the Hebrides</cite> to be furnished by Collings and Rowlandson.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> A somewhat different version of the origin of this caricature is given in the <cite>Memoirs of John
Bannister, Comedian</cite>, by John Adolphus (8vo., 1839): 'His friend and fellow-student Rowlandson
was, unhappily, much addicted to games of chance, and Bannister used to remonstrate with him on
the subject with amiable but ineffectual perseverance. On one of these occasions John Raffaelle
Smith, the engraver, admonished Bannister on the inutility of his efforts. "You may spare your
sympathy and advice also," he said; "for that Tom Rowlandson was, is, and ever will be incurable."
The artist, in merry revenge, brought out a print called <cite>Hawks and a Pigeon</cite>, in which Smith, endowed
for the occasion with a most villanous aspect, the very personation of a sharper and a knave, exhibited
conspicuously.
</p>
<p>
'By way of reprisal, Smith produced a well-known and popular engraving, in which Rowlandson
and some others are represented as confederates in fleecing an innocent. Bannister lent his aid in
forming the group, and, putting on for the occasion a face from which all appearance of sense was
effectually banished, sat for the young dupe. Parsons on seeing the production said: "Why, Jack!
you are the last of your fraternity that I should have selected for the model of a flat. Why, when you
were a little Cupid in the green-room, Kitty Clive, who was not apt to mince matters, used to say you
looked as innocent as a little sucking devil."'</p></div>

Rowlandson, which possessed great art merit; and adds: 'I possess early drawings by him, executed
with a fine quill pen, and most tenderly tinted, which are highly refined in style, excellent in drawing,
and in elegance and grace may be classed with the productions of Stothard.'</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_22" id="Footnote_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> From Malcolm's <cite>Manners and Customs of London during the Eighteenth Century</cite> (1810). 'Mr.
Carlton, Deputy Clerk of the Peace, and Clerk to the Justices of Westminster, stated to a Committee
of the House of Commons, in 1782, that E O Tables were very numerous; that one house in the
parish of St. Anne, Soho, contained five, and that there were more than three hundred in the above
parish of St. James's: those were used every day of the week, and servants enticed to them by cards
of direction thrown down the areas.'</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_23" id="Footnote_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> Lord North's Administration, which had the onus of conducting the American War, was daily
growing weaker and losing popularity; it resigned in March of the year following, and the Rockingham
Ministry came into office. The first condition of this more liberal Administration had obtained,
through the negotiations of Lord Shelburne, the consent of the King to 'peace with the Americans, and
the acknowledgment of their independence.' In a later caricature by Gillray, which appeared on the
resignation of Lord North&mdash;<cite>Banco to the Knave</cite>, April 12, 1782&mdash;the figure of Sir Grey Cooper, one
of the Treasury Secretaries, is introduced, exclaiming, 'I want a new master.' On this gentleman's
chair is the name '<em>Sir Grey Parole</em>,' because, it is understood, he usually sat on the left of Lord North
on the Treasury Bench; and when that statesman, who trusted to his memory for the principal points
elicited in the debates, had been overcome by the constitutional somnolency which was a favourite
subject of ridicule with the satirists, the Secretary aroused his chief, and supplied the deficiency of
notes by suggesting the thread of argument, or <em>parole</em>, as required.</p></div>

Mr. Fox did not deny that he had said he could have his Bill ready within a day or two&mdash;he said so
still; but, as there was not, at present, any Government&mdash;any strong, and efficient, and constitutional
Government&mdash;he thought it would be absurd to enter on the discussion of any measure; since, whatever
it might be, it would not be carried into execution.'&mdash;<cite>Morning Post</cite>, Feb. 9, 1784.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_27" id="Footnote_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> 'The present Orchestra (1809) was first exhibited to the public on the 2nd June, 1735. It
was built by an ingenious mechanic, named Maidman, a common carpenter employed in the gardens,
from a design of his own. The composition with which it is ornamented was also his own discovery.
This elegant orchestra is calculated to contain fifty performers, with an organ, &amp;c. It is illuminated
by about four thousand lamps, and presents an object of unparalleled brilliance. The same ingenious
artisan erected the rotunda, which is seventy feet in diameter, and represents a magnificent pavilion.
Within it is placed another orchestra, where the musical part of the entertainment is performed in
unfavourable weather. Adjoining the saloon, with its <em>scagliola</em> columns, and its paintings by Hayman,
is a supper room, one hundred feet long and forty feet wide, with a double row of columns. On the
walls are represented paintings of rural scenery, which answer to the intercolumniations. At the end
of the room was the statue of Handel, in white marble, and in the character of Orpheus singing to his
lyre; but it is now removed behind the orchestra in the garden. This fine piece of sculpture first
introduced the abilities of Roubiliac to the notice of the public. It was begun and completed in the
place of which it was the ornament, while the noble subject and the superior artist were enjoying the
friendly and protecting hospitality of Mr. Jonathan Tyers, who purchased the place in 1730, and
opened it with an attractive entertainment which he called a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ridotto al Fresco</i>.
</p>
<p>
'The grove, principal entrance, and other parts of the gardens are furnished with a number of
small pavilions, ornamented with paintings, chiefly by Hogarth and Hayman; each containing a table
and seats, to which the company retire to partake of refreshments.'&mdash;<cite>Microcosm of London.</cite></p></div>

was one of those ladies whose career on the stage was without reproach. She was painted by several
of the first artists, and among others by Sir Joshua Reynolds, in one of her best characters. No
female, perhaps, that ever appeared on the stage looked more lovely than she in <em>Fair Rosamond</em>.

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_31" id="Footnote_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> It must be remembered that in 1788 the public were flocking to the performances of a famous

<cite>A Brace of Blackguards</cite>, introducing George Moreland the painter and himself under a situation little
complimentary to the softening influences of the fine arts. The plate is given in this work under the
date <i>May 30, 1812</i>, when it was re-issued by the artist, but the original etching properly belongs to a
much earlier period, and was probably executed about a quarter of a century anterior.</p></div>

<h2>Transcriber's Notes:</h2>

<p>Footnotes have been moved to the end of each chapter (in the text
version) and to the end of the text (html version).</p>

<p>Illustrations have been moved to paragragh breaks in a direction which
brings them closer to their descriptions. In the html version this has left blank pages
where page numbers are omitted.</p>

<p>Obvious typos and punctuation errors have been corrected.</p>

<p>There are many instances of double choices for hyphenations. Some same
